Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  • Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  • Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  • Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  • Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  • When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it's better understood
     Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  • Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn't believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
      Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  • Was recently informed by institution's pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  • Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren't just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  • The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  • The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn't yet read it and hadn't seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren't additional changes.
