After reactive review of 057 OS and ORR, and clarification of his understanding data for KN001/010, TL was very 'shocked' by how much better nivo looked for PDL1+ OS and RR.  His impression was that >1% cutoff of pembro ""really didn't do much to enrich anything"".  and that even with all the caveats of cross-trial comparison, that a difference of 7m in median OS (between >1% in KN-010 2mg and 057) was ""profound"".

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
•	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ""wild west"", meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
•	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
•	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
•	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
•	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
•	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
•	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he'll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
•	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
•	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
•	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
•	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
•	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
•	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy.",1466395200.0

"RTL said he would ""essentially have to"" use Opdivo at his institution since the formulary will have a strong preference for OS data, limiting the use of Keytruda. He said this might not be true for community practices.",1482469200.0
"SCCHN RTL said she will use Opdivo over Keytruda due to the strength of the -141 data, particularly the survival data",1479877200.0
"Prior to our conversation, RTL did not know that Opdivo SCCHN approval includes all patients treated with prior cisplatin, not just metastatic patients in second-line. She now feels this will be large market for Opdivo.",1479013200.0
"RTL said during a conference that she prefers Q3W dosing of Keytruda. She was aware of Opdivo OS data, which she found compelling, and the study population differences. A different community TL at the same conference felt that many community TLs will not see Q3W as such an important factor, and might prefer Opdivo for billing reasons. After we went through all of the relevant data, he says Opdivo is much more impressive and he plans on using it for his patients. This includes switching from a patient who was recently started on Keytruda.",1479013200.0
"Several TLs suggested they see biomarker testing as ""informative,"" but not treatment-guiding when considering using anti-PD-1 therapy for SCCHN. As a result, they wouldn't routinely test in this population",1475985600.0
"RTL feels Keytruda and Opdivo are the same, and that Merck has clear advantage in SCCHN based on Q3W. However, she said a significant population of patients do  prefer the ""security"" of Q2W dosing. RTL was aware of population differences in KN-055 vs. CM-141.",1473220800.0
"H&N RTL said that she routinely has patients ask for immunotherapeutic treatment, and she believes Opdivo could quickly replace SOC depending on efficacy data.",1457499600.0
"RTL says she avoids using EXTREME in first-line, both due to toxicity and the inconvenience for the patient. She feels IO will be immediately adopted in first-line whenever it becomes available.",1481432400.0
"2.	Met with regional Lung AI, who is also on the Head and Neck NCCN committee, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
a.	AI disclosed membership on the Head and Neck NCCN panel and is also the chair for the upcoming updates.
b.	AI shared some unsolicited insights on the topic of how NCCN committees in general consider and review guidelines and updates.  AI says that although the consent and approval of all panelists is sought, the process for doing that can be rather informal, depending on the specific chair of the committee.  For example, review/consent/approval may be done through email communication.",1458878400.0
"In two community oncologist encounters I have heard of cetuximab+RT being the preferred option for locally advanced disease. In one case, a community oncologist said he was planning to use cetuximab+IM proton therapy in a metastic patient who had relapsed after extensive surgical history in combating spreading HN cancer originating in the oral cavity.",1481086800.0
RTL stated that he will not be warehousing SCCHN patients until Nivolumab approval and will start a patient on Pembro the following week.  He added that it is a clear disadvantage for BMS that Merck received the indication first.,1472616000.0
"At conference speaker for H&N data stated the Keynote study for SCCHN trial was ""carefully"" monitored and she beleived more pts were HPV+ than a normal pt populations. She believes more research needs to be conducted to determine what the actual PD status percentage is of H&N pts. During the presentation she highlighted that Pem is now approved for SCCHN and that pts continued to respond after tx 2y cutoff in Keynote study. 
SCCHN data presentation also highlighted Checkmate study  where she stated IO will be the new Standard of Care. She believes the pem/nivo drugs are the same. She believes the prices really are the same between pem/nivo and are overall expensive for a pt population that 50% of pts still do not respond. She believes more research is needed to determine which is the best way to pick a responder and suggest possibly looking at Circulating Tumor Cells. 

Speaker shared at podium that she hopes to see IO in 1st line setting and more importantly adjuvant tx for pts to never then enter into the metastatic setting for SCCHN. 

In a private interaction the speaker disclosed she felt BMS trials are better and more inclusive, that the Keynote trial took a very long time (4-6 weeks in her opinion) to get a pt enrolled and on drug, so she believes the data is skewed due to the poorer prognostic pts dying before getting on trial. 
Reponse to 026 data was that Merck's strategy finally paid off by excluding such a large portion of pts in Lung Ca, with the 50% cut off  panning out in first line.",1472184000.0
Np from large institution discussed SCCHN pts reluctance to report toxicity and their reluctance to go off tx with opdivo. It is a concern in her clinic. if a pt is responding they hold back tox reporting even more so. She stated education sessions are imperative with every visit and involving the family to keep these pts safe.,1481086800.0
