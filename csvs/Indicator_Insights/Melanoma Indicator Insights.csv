"fHEOR, HSL, and RAE met with 10 clinical pharmacists on P&T of large regional payer (5M lives) in Great Lakes to review Opdivo current indications and fulfill previously reactively requested pipeline overview. During the melanoma review, there were several questions on biomarkers, namely BRAF and PD-L1. There was payer confusion thinking the bulk of the efficacy came from either Opdivo or Yervoy in 067, and not regimen, as they were only assessing PFS and were getting confused between PD-L1 and BRAF. Education on the key efficacy endpoints occurred by both fHEOR and HSL. Discussed pseudoprogression occurrence with an I/O agent and why it is important to assess ORR, along with hazard ratio, and median PFS. Further discussion on biomarkers was brought up by the payer, and they requested a second deep dive discussion on melanoma and biomarkers (PD-L1 and BRAF). Payer submitted P&T policy draft to fHEOR, which included a table breaking down Opdivo, Yervoy, and regimen based on PD-L1 status for PFS, ORR and tumor burden change. 

Questions submitted to fHEOR by two separate payer Opdivo SMEs:  
1.	""I understand that the OS data is not predicted to be out till Oct 2017, however, the efficacy data for Opdivo as monotherapy in BRAF mutation (in comparison with Yervoy as monotherapy) is not compelling enough to warrant making it 1st line (that is based on PFS data you have thus far). The combination therapy seems to only benefit PDL-1 negative expression population, while PDL-1 positive population had comparable outcomes in comparison with monotherapy."" 

2.	""When I initially looked at the data, I looked at the progression free survival.  In PDL1 (+ve ) group, there was no difference between the Opdivo and the Opdivo + Yervoy group.  After today's meeting, I realized that it's more worthwhile to look at ORR.  When looking at the ORR in both the groups it looks like Opdivo is doing most of the work.  Is there a benefit in adding Yervoy? For the PDL( -ve )group  the difference in ORR  (%) between the 2 arms is 13.5 %.  In the PDL (+ve ) group the difference in ORR(%) between the two arms  is  14.6%. What does the difference of 13.5% or 14.6% mean? Is the 13.5% or 14.6 % statistically significant?

"Met with a national AI/TL NCCN melanoma panelist who provided the following insights:

-	Meeting was during SIV presentation to investigators for RCC follow-up trial so the meeting was a brief sideline introduction before the group presentation began.
-	Made AI aware that the NCCN Melanoma Compendium for Opdivo has not been updated to be consistent with the updated Opdivo label/PI, in light of the 067 update.
-	Specifically informed AI of the updates needed under ""FDA Indications"" column of the compendium.  Communicated need to be updated to reflect that Opdivo is approved now as monotherapy and regimen for both WT and MT patients.

"Biomedical Learning Institute 1st Annual Symposium on Integrating Immune Therapies & Target Therapies into Standards of Care for Heme and Solid Malignancies; San Fran Sept 10, 2016 
Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
•	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
•	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
•	We don't need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
•	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
•	In reference to 1st line lung press releases – ""Merck cherry picked their patients"" for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ""isn't going anywhere"", since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
•	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
•	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
•	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
•	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
•	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ""does not exist in lung"" ""pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression""
•	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn't sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don't survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ""The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo"" 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ""very toxic"" and ""very effective"" tx. Targeted Tx's are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

"Melanoma/Lung RTL had participated in pembro melanoma EAP and due to good experiences and preferred Q3w dosing, ""found no reason to try nivo in melanoma"" (ie during 1L or 2L monotherapy).   Once RTL started using nivo for lung (and is ademantly against PLD1 testing so won't use pembro for lung) has switched over almost completely to nivo in melanoma also.  ""If efficacy is the roughly the same, it just makes sense to stick with the one drug in a class that is most broadly usable.

"Regional IDN with owned oncology practices has communicated that they are using a mixed approach for dosing opdivo in RCC, mel and NSCLC.  In this case they are using 3mg/kg for patients below 80kg and 240mg for pts >80kg.  Also he shared that with vial overfill and +/-10% dose efficiency adjustments he projects his current opdivo usage program to save his system ~$200K per year.  As this IDN has been acquired by Kaiser, he shared that he communicated this as a ""best practice"" to a broader KP oncology subcommittee and it has been shared through the KP system.

"during the inservice in emory palliative care, one of the leading attendings discussed ongoing difficulties in management of musculo-skeletal pain induced by nivolimab in patients with ongoing multiple co-morbidities. Further explanation showed that palliative care is currently very limited in situations when patients who are on opioids with already compromised renal or liver functions and continue to benefit from IO therapy but now unable to cope with increasing muscle/bone pain. Very common for patients not to report pain to his/her oncologist in fear of discontinuation of therapy. Increasing opiods does not bring a desired pain relief and adding large doses of Tylenol or ibuprofen in the setting of other co-morbidities may not be an option for these patients. The most common outcome for patient  was discontinuation of opdivo therapy.
This attending also expressed a desire for a specific care manual with emphasis on challenging supportive care situations in the setting of immune therapies.
