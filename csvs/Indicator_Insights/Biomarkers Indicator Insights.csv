Path TL reports Ventana has trained TL and 4 other pathologists at TL's center on SP142 scoring in bladder and lung but there have been zero requests,1481259600.0
Path TL stated that Integrated Oncology sends the 28-8 testing to a third party and they don't send back a stained slide so TL refuses to send out for 28-8 testing,1481259600.0
"Path TL reports since pembro 1st line approval TL has  integrated PD-L1 test ordering into EPIC system and is available for all solid tumors
-There are 2 check boxes in EPIC for ordering testing:
1. ""PD-L1 keytruda/pembrolizumab (IHC)""
2. ""PD-L1 opdivo/nivolumab (IHC)""
-Since integrating with EPIC, requests increased to 2-3/day

TL pathologist reports being pushed to use the SP142 assay internally but has seen lower staining of tumor cells and does not feel good about the amplification step to intensify the staining so has switched to SP263 on Ventana platform.,1478059200.0
TL pathologist estimated about 10% of lung patients express PD-L1 >50%; about 70 cases are testing every 3 months by an outside lab.,1478059200.0
"TL has been reporting PD-L1 expression percentages and indicating ""positive for keytruda"" at >50% but now (due to different cut-offs in different lines of therapy) is considering omitting the positivity statement and leave it to the oncologist to make that call",1477627200.0
Pathology does not know what therapeutic line patients are on currently but TL thinks this may change soon with pembro 1st line approval.,1477627200.0
"TL has conferred with oncologists due to pembros 1L approval and has purposed a new algorithm for testing.

She feels current studies are too limited from the start (i.e. specific biomarker, tumor type, etc) and may miss any early efficacy signals. She would prefer to see more basket type trials that capture a broader patient base in phase 1.",1472184000.0
"Data from the Blueprint project was presented at the Fall SWOG meeting. Presenter discussed the data re: different results if assays and algorithms are mismatched (37%).

2.	Adaptive immune signature expression and correlation wit response   
•	Signature consists of 12 markers (not fully disclosed)
•	CTLA blockade:  immune signature failed to predict response to Ipi
•	Pre-PD1 treatment biopsy failed to predict response to PD1 treatment
o	Early treatment biopsy analysis of immune signiture within 2 doses of PD1 treatment predicted response to PD1 treatment.  Saw significantly higher expression of immune markers (CD8+, CD4, CD3, PDL1, Lag-3).  IFN-gamma and MHC class I and II downregulated (antigen presentation compromised)

Patients with tumors that share the same genetic abnormality regardless of tumor type will receive the drug that targets that abnormality.  She stated there is a strong focus on rare tumor types but also includes large tumor types as well (breast, prostate, lung, CRC).  She said the study opened in August 2015 and enrolled 800 pts rapidly by November 2015.  She said there's a lot of enthusiasm among participating sites for enrolling into the study.  She said an Interim Analysis was started around Nov-Dec of last year.  She said all the tumor samples were being processed and analyzed by MDACC and sample processing was ""backed up"" due quantity of samples.  She said there are significant delays to testing sometimes taking up to a month to get results back.  She said they were expected to re-open the study in 01-2016 but it was post-poned until this month. During this time, new enrollment was stopped.  She stated also during the Interim Analysis they decided to add 14 additional arms bringing the total number of arms to 24 and add additional labs for genetic analysis.  She said there was a low genetic match rate to drugs available with just the 10 arms and increasing the number of arms with drugs targeting specific mutations may increase likelihood of pts matching to one of the treatment arms.

"A Lung TL informed me that his institution is trying to determine whether or not to buy a PD-L1 testing platform.  The Pathologist turned to this Lung TL to determine what the frequency of PD-L1 testing will be in the future.  If the frequency of testing is going to be low, then its more cost effective to continue sending out the testing to an outside lab group.  However if they project the testing is going to become common, then the pathology department may buy the platform and conduct the test inhouse (to decrease cost).",1461556800.0
"A national lung TL said that pathology depts may eventually drive which PD1 inhibitor MDs will prescribe in the first line setting.  He believes that a pathology lab will not optimize their IHC for each of the 4 PDL1 staining kits, but will only choose one.  Since pembro currently requires PDL1 testing, he thinks most sites will optimize staining with their PDL1 antibody and potentially choose pembro in the first line.",1455253200.0
