"Comments from Academic NTL on treatment landscapes in RCC, pre-/post-Nivo approval:
a.	NTL stated that, since Opdivo/RCC FDA approval, he receives 'a lot' of questions from community oncologists asking about switching RCC patients from VEGF TKI to Nivolumab 'at the first sign of toxicity'. In NTL's opinion, this haste to switch to Nivo ""may short-change patients from the full benefit of the TKI.""
b.	NTL stated that most TKI-related toxicities occur within the first month of Tx. If you can get the patient through that, they can often start to tolerate the TKI. Hence, prior to Nivo, oncologists would manage TKI toxicities with dose-adjustments or take a short break from treatment for a few days, then resume the same TKI Tx.  
c.	Since Nivo approval, community oncologists are not waiting to see if the patient can begin to tolerate the TKI. They'll just switch to Nivo. However, in his academic institution, NTL stated that they still try to get the full benefit from the TKI before switching to Nivo. 

NTL comments on preferred sequencing of treatments for RCC (TKI-->TKI or TKI-->Nivo):
a.	""Data from CA209-025 just show that Nivo is better than Everolimus.  It's yet another study showing that Everolimus is an *inferior* treatment in the 2L, just like in the METEOR study with Cabo vs Everolimus"". 
b.	""I haven't seen the data, but the Exelixis press release indicates Cabo provides OS advantage over Everolimus, just like Nivo.  Once Cabo gets approved, it's anyone's guess as to how we should sequence Nivo and Cabo.""
c.	NTL stated that he doesn't see any evidence that an MOA switch away from TKis is inherently beneficial. If a patient responds well to 1L TKI, NTL believes there is reason to expect a response from a 2L TKI.  
d.	""There is no data showing that 2L Nivo is better than a 2L TKI.""  Due to small patient numbers, NTL doesn't hold much stock in the METEOR sub-group analysis at ASCO-GU showing PFS was better with Cabo Tx if patients received prior Nivo.
e.	NTL stopped short of stating that he would use Cabo in 2L and Nivo in 3L. However, pooling all of the above comments and his existing preference for MOA continuation, this would be my expectation, unless there are convincing data to support Nivo 2L then Cabo 3L.",Unknown,1457326800.0,,"Comments from Academic NTL on treatment landscapes in RCC, pre-/post-Nivo approval:

•	AI is on her institution's P&T so is interested in the topic of value and pathways in oncology and oncology meds
•	AI is interested in learning and connecting with BMS HSL and HEOR resources on the topic of value and pathways in oncology
•	AI does not have many non-clear cell RCC patients, consistent with low incidence of disease generally.  She thinks even though Nivo label does not have non-clear cell patients, she's treated these patients with nivolumab and she says it makes sense to her to try these patients given limited treatment options available for non-clear cell patients.  
•	She says her institution does not treat RCC patients in first line with Avastin so prior Avastin therapy does not limit her use of nivo in 2nd line.
•	She's interested in potential ISR's in non-clear cell patients, perhaps using nivo monotherapy or regimen.  
•	She said she's seen that regimen is not well tolerated, mostly due to ipi.  She has seen severe AE's with thyroid AE's.

"Met with regional AI/TL in melanoma/RCC, who shared the following unsolicited insights:
•	He said in melanoma, he is impressed with the 2y OS demonstrated by the 069 data, which cements his belief in the regimen. 
•	He said he decides whether to use regimen or Nivo mono based upon how severe the melanoma is, for example less severe can be treated with Nivo to hopefully reduce tumor, and then treat with monotherapy.  This also allows for regimen to preserved for 2L.  
•	If melanoma is more severe initially, then might start with regimen in 1L.  
•	Reactively Reviewed the higher ORR Data in 067 when comparing regimen versus Nivo monotherapy, even for PDL1 more than or equal to 1% patients, which seemed to cement his belief in higher efficacy of regimen as he noted he was aware of higher ORR data here.
•	He currently doesn't test for PDL1 before treating melanoma patients, because he sees benefit for all expression levels.
•	He also treats RCC patients and he says he is aware of newly released Cabo data, but still prefers Nivo due to efficacy.
•	He shared that his institution has location specific formulary currently, meaning each facility (eg.

"Renal/GU Onc TL discussed Pseudo-progression. His RCC patients had slight progression and he continued the Opdivo tx for additional 2-3 cycles with no regression and ended tx. Once pt returned to community, the Onc there called back to TL to challenge him for continuing tx. TL feels there is still some confusion in medical community and even Academic surrounding this concept. 

He also mentioned that he takes calls often from community asking about psuedo progression and how to determine what to do with a pt on Opdivo or ImmunoTherapy.",Unknown,1470801600.0,,"Renal/GU Onc TL discussed Pseudo-progression.

"Given how crowded the 2L RCC environment will be in the near future feels that an agent with a biomarker will have a significant advantage. Hence, BMS previously had an incentive to ""pick a bad biomarker (e.g. PDL1) so that Opdivo could be indicated in all-comers, but should now become more invested in identifying a better biomarker.""",Unknown,1456462800.0,,"Given how crowded the 2L RCC environment will be in the near future feels that an agent with a biomarker will have a significant advantage.
