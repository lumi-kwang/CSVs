"We met with a small regional health plan for primarily an introductory meeting.They were very aware of the 026 data.  They shared that last year they had attempted to develop oncology specific guidelines/pathways and that it became very challenging due to the fast pace of change in the therapeutic area. They found that most of what they were aligning to was in the NCCN guidelines, so they decided to use them, and the product label as an overarching guide to coverage. They asked about the cost of regimen.  They were aware of the Yervoy APP.They had very little as far as questions about 026 and ESMO, as I think we covered the issues in advance of any questions that they may have had.  They did say it was commendable that a broad patient population was studied and understood that the cuts by various levels of PDL-1 did not hold up due to study design.  We also clarified with them the rationale of using PFS vs OS due to cross over anticipation of the chemo group to the standard of care, and with that reinforced the 2nd line standard of care – Opdivo.

"A Regional TL clinical trials PI with academic affiliation at a VA hospital commented that he has not used Keytruda since Opdivo can be used without testing for PD-L1. He discussed with his hema/onco fellows the possibility of using chemo instead of Opdivo in PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients since, even though OS was numerically higher in the Opdivo arm, no statistically significant difference in OS was found between treatment arms. Nevertheless they concluded that, worst case scenario, Opdivo is still as effective as chemo in this population but with a better safety profile. Therefore, Opdivo is clearly the best option for NSCLC patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression. In his opinion Opdivo is very well tolerated by patients, much better than chemo.

On PDL-1 expression, when discussing the indications and trial designs of the current 2 agents, he proactively stated that felt rather strongly that the way the trials were designed should guide how the agents are used.  In discussing potential first line use, he stated that as pembrolizumab is being studied in this setting in the greater than 50% staining population, then pembro really should be limited in it's use in that population.  He stated that if Nivo is studied in greater than 5% (or 1%), then Nivo should be used in that population.

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ""market"" pembro as the drug of choice in the ""positive"" or ""high staining"" patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.

•	 Suggested that the following factors probably contributed to the negative results: inclusion of very low PDL1 expressors and low power resulting in major imbalances between groups. 
•	Commented that the PFS KM curves were baffling. Asked if pseudoprogressions in the nivo arm might have played a role (noted that pseudoprogressions seem to be rarer with NSCLC than melanoma, but first follow-up assessment in CM-026 took place early at 6 wks).
•	Suggested that nivo had shown no clinical activity in CM-026. After being reminded that PFS, OS, and ORR were similar in both study arms, agreed that it was more appropriate to conclude that nivo had an efficacy similar to that of CT in PDL1 ≥5% NSCLC, with a better safety profile."

"The following insights were gleaned from an NCCN NSCLC panelist in the Midwest institution

•	After reviewing the 026 deck, AI commented that the study design was flawed. She stated they were really hoping for Nivo in an all comers population in the 1L.
•	A discussion around the discussant's (Soria) comments/tweets at ESMO when he compared the trials (we confirmed that you can't compare data across trials, but can look at differences in trials)
o	Differences in trial designs (CM026/KN 024)  and imbalances were discussed (never smokers, PDL1 expression differences, non-stratified PDL1 expression, cross over rates, females, health of pt pop). We discussed that Soria stated only ~10-15% of the patients in the real world would match the patient population in KN 024. 
	This led to the question of why BMS designed their trial this way. She stated she is accustomed to BMS having stronger trials. 
•	Panelist confirmed that females do better in her experience
•	Panelist is aware of ICER, but is not participating in the review. 
•	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS' stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she's heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She's unsure how they will get paid. She agreed with BMS request to not be in the guidelines as their institution and BMS align in their EBM thinking.
•	AI stated the biggest unmet need for patients with 1L lung cancer is to provide an effective therapy with minimal toxicity to patients with poor PS. She stated that's were I/O can really show it's benefit. 012 and 227 design were reactively discussed. She's excited about 227. 
•	She stated there's a big education gap on the side of the patient. She feels patients are still trying to push through their IMAR.

•	After reviewing the 026 deck, AI commented that the study design was flawed. She stated they were really hoping for Nivo in an all comers population in the 1L.
•	A discussion around the discussant's (Soria) comments/tweets at ESMO when he compared the trials (we confirmed that you can't compare data across trials, but can look at differences in trials)

We discussed that Soria stated only ~10-15% of the patients in the real world would match the patient population in KN 024.

•	Panelist confirmed that females do better in her experience
•	Panelist is aware of ICER, but is not participating in the review. 
•	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS' stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she's heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She's unsure how they will get paid.

-Believes that the term ""value"" is currently more of a talking point than something actionable. However, in light of -024 and -026, he sees ""value"" as defining a population and not just giving expensive drugs to every patient that walks through the door.

♣	AI says PDL1 not yet determinative in 2L, for example in 017 SQ NSCLC, why does it make no difference?
♣	He says he will not deny treatment in 2L NSCLC, even if tested in 1L and has 0% PDL1 expression
♣	Why less gr ¾ AE's in 012 lung versus melanoma?
o	AI says he doesn't know.  Dose in 012 is different (lower ipi dose (nivo3/ipi1), may be factor.  
♣	It's highly unlikely that Nivo and Pembro are significantly different.
♣	AI says that in the context of CM 026 negative result, he believes that Nivo and Pembro are not significantly different.  He also said PDL1 threshold cuts of data were different than in KN 024, so it will be interesting to see efficacy at different PDL1 cuts of data from CM 026.
♣	In AI's practice, he looks at whether a patient is having clinical deterioration, not just imaging, in determining whether to continue patient on Immunotherapy past progression on imaging."

A pharmacist inquired is there a difference between the various PD1 inhibitors on the market (almost looking to select one agent as the preferred agent). The pharmacist was specifically asking questions regarding clinical efficacy in checkmate 26 versus pemrbolizumab in front line lung.,Unknown,1479272400.0,,A pharmacist inquired is there a difference between the various PD1 inhibitors on the market (almost looking to select one agent as the preferred agent).
