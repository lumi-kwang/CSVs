"Met with VP of Oncology for National Payer at ASCO Quality meeting
Noted Agenda Items
1.	Pathways: As she's state previously she can't comment on timing or expected changes to pathway until they are publicly disclosed.  She did say that pathways can be reviewed as frequently as every quarter (as is the case for melanoma right now) or as infrequently as annually (as is the case for CML where there were no changes).  Although she was very aware of all the data for lung and melanoma which leads us to believe that they have recently reviewed these two pathways.  She was not terribly impressed with the non-squamous NSCLC data seeing only a 2 months improvement in OS vs chemo.  She noted that two oncologists (Yale and MD Anderson) had noted high rates of colitis (10-15%) which required a fair amount of anti-TNF use.  In her mind, Avastin is less toxic and less expensive in these patients.  As for regimen in melanoma, she felt that the ORR rates were not clinically meaningful when it comes to durability of response and that pseudo-progression makes it difficult to determine responses.  She would like to see OS.
2.	The healthplan plans to look at outcomes (ER visits, end of life care, etc.) by end of the year on pathway's patients.  Not interested in patient level QOLs for the pathways.
3.	Overall, gives no weight to the Keytruda data….she pointed out inconsistencies in the data and seemed very underwhelmed by these data.
4.	RCC guidelines are being developed.  Has reviewed the data.  No concerns.

As follow-up to Item 1,  I did discuss data with her on the AEs associated with lung cancer (poster going to ASCO) which costs AEs in 017 and 057 which shows AEs are statistically and notably higher in the chemo arms compared to mono Opdivo.

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ""aha moment"" and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",Unknown,1456635600.0,,"1.

If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he'll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don't want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ""tail end of curve"" and that's what he discusses with pts and that's what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ""aha moment"" and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system"

Stated almost all patients start on triple Tx now…..Thus on Refractory/Relapse this limits Elo use as pt already treated with Rev.  Acknowledged Elo would be option but docs there did not see it that way

Stated he felt BMS needed to get DFCI and Mayo on board with Elo as they drive a lot of heme thinking in this ""space""

"A hematologist at a leading academic hospital in Boston discussed the mechanisms of resistance to daratumumab in a Grand Rounds presentation.   Daratumumab is not toxic to hematopoietic stem cells and thus could be used a consolidation modality for ASCT.  These stem cells express very low levels of CD-38, and thus unable to elicit complement dependent cytotoxicity on treatment with daratumumab.  In a conversation later, she revealed that in multiple myeloma cells resistant to daratumumab, the CD-38 levels appear to be maintained at a high level.

We discussed what the customer thought of research, and what BMS might learn such as how the total cost of care differs in a model with an IO agent like Opdivo versus docectaxel in metastatic lung.  This data would inform future agreements for them and introduce our teams to value as defined by our customers.  We will take this feedback internally and see what is feasible, attainable and timely."
"I met with a NV area pharmacy lead for a national Oncology Network.  Through the course of our discussion, he detailed how he personally met with Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid about the new Medicare pricing proposal and the impact on NV Cancer treatment and how Medicare is unilaterally determining health policy decisions and circumnavigating the congress and democratic due process for law making.  He leveraged that 85% of all southern NV cancer care runs through his group and that the proposed ASP + 2.5 will 'put us out of business and you will have a health crisis in NV and elsewhere'.  He also reports that he met with local congressman as well sharing the same message.

He reports that the congressman signed the joint Republican and Democrat letter to Medicare, and that Harry Reid placed a call directly to the Sec of Medicare and 'gave him a piece of his mind'.

"fHEOR, HSL and RAE met with pharmacy and medical director P&T team of regional plan in Great Lakes (6M lives, commercial PPO, HMO, and Medicare Advantage) as a follow-up to Opdivo PVP meeting previously. Meeting focused on key previously provided reactive questions: 
1.	Use of Opdivo in BRAF mutant population. Payer previously felt Yervoy worked better than Opdivo in BRAF mutant population due to confidence interval crossing one.  Payer shared they were considering requiring a step through Yervoy for the BRAF mutant population. Shared RECIST criteria and how response was measured and educated payer on MOA and the importance of looking at ORR and hazard ratio when looking at response in lieu of OS data. Payer shared they do not believe clinicians use RECIST to determine response. Reactively shared anecdotal clinical experience from matrix team regarding BRAF being used more as prognostic and not predictive biomarker, as well as its place in determining use of BRAF+MEK inhibitor use for patients with bulky disease prior to I/O therapy. Payer confirmed this is what access influencers / local clinicians also educated her on. Reactively shared ORR BRAF breakdown, OS of AACR 069 data, OS of 004, and 064 sequencing study to help understand larger picture. Data from 064 sequencing study helped her see that doing a step of Yervoy prior to Opdivo for melanoma patients would not be helpful. Payer felt satisfied with our response and felt comfortable with not using BRAF to assess Opdivo efficacy going forward. 
2.	Use of Opdivo-Yervoy regimen in PD-L1 negative population. Payer shared awareness of study design and the inability to compare regimen to Opdivo monotherapy; however, expressed the large numerical difference in performance between regimen and monotherapy and didn't see the advantage of regimen when looking at PFS as an endpoint. Again educated payer on pseudoprogression due to MOA, the need to look at ORR and HR while we wait for OS data, and the durability of response seen. Shared reactively survival benefit in clinical trials (slide 29 in HEOR deck), AACR 069 OS data broken out by PD-L1, 067 ORR by PD-L1, and 004 data. Payer felt satisfied with response provided and saw the need to use ORR. Payer expressed interest in future OS data when available and updates post ASCO.
3.	Safety concerns leading to high discontinuation rates and an inability to complete required course of therapy. Payer shared the following via email post the meeting, ""I wanted to know for the members that only could tolerate less than the four Ipi/Nivo doses, did they do just as well clinically as the patients that were able to tolerate more doses. I am worried that with the ADE's for the combination that we would put the patients at risk for not completing enough therapy to cure their disease.  IF we are going to invest in their therapy, we would want to give the patient the best chance possible for cure."" Verbally shared with customer via phone that we have a melanoma registry recently initiated to answer these questions and that sequencing was a major topic of focus, but we don't have enough data yet. Customer asked whether we have dosing with different ipi dosing schedules and reactively shared our lung regimen dosing which extends ipi to 6 weeks. Customer was intrigued with this data.

She was also impressed that the model did not just look at acquisition cost, but other aspects as well, eg administration cost, cost of AE etc.  Her final comment was this gives her additional support to discuss forecasting and the budget needed with her VPs in the coming years.

•	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
•	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
•	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
•	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that's not the patient you have.
•	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE's who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.

•	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
•	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn't elaborate further).
•	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
•	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
•	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.

•	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
•	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
•	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
•	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that's not the patient you have.
•	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE's who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.
