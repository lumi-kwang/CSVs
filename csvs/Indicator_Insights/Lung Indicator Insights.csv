Regional Health Plan has good foundational knowledge. The process they follow is that the product use must fall within the indications or guidelines.  The pharmacy director is the decision maker if the product use is outside both of those.,1457326800.0
"TL reports about 15-20% of lung patients are >50% staining for PD-L1 expression, the vast majority are 1-49%",1477627200.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter highlighted the following as the main characteristics of I-O: proven efficacy, sustained duration of response, specific and manageable toxicity, less toxicity compared to chemo, possibility of being used in patients with compromised performance status, combination therapy is possible, delayed responses can occur, and low index of CR (usually PR or SD).",1456462800.0
Several TLs have commented that Merck's strategy is to promote the need to test for PD-L1 with Keytruda in NSCLC as an advantage since you can prescribe a drug to which the patient is more likely to respond.,1460692800.0
"A TL with academic affiliation commented that, as of today, the only reason to perform a PD-L1 test is if you are considering Keytruda as an alternative for NSCLC patients. One of the problems is that usually there is not enough tissue to perform all the tests he would like to order. For NSCLC, he initially requests the full panel of tests and, if the pathology lab says there is not enough tissue, he then prioritize in the following other: EGFR, then ALK, then ROS, and last PD-L1.",1460692800.0
"A TL with academic affiliation commented that Genoptix has the PD-L1 test available and is offering it as part of the lung panel. Their business model is that they order the full panel of tests and then bill the health plan to see which are covered. If the health plan does not provide coverage to certain tests they ask for health plan reconsideration but never send a bill to the patient. In his opinion Genoptix provides excellent service. Test results were available within a week. Initially he tried performing the PD-L1 test with Quest but there was a lot of delay and, at the end, it was impossible to get the results.",1460692800.0
"A TL, clinical trials PI and AI commented that she is very interested in Opdivo's 1st line NSCLC data. She believes it has the potential to become the SOC in 1st line. Based on the impressive results in 2nd line, she believes Opdivo will be even better in the 1st line setting since the patient's immune system is expected to be stronger in a patient that has not received chemo.",1460001600.0
"A TL shared that he has not had a good experience with Opdivo in NSCLC patients that have been refractory to multiple lines of therapy. He has recently treated 4 highly refractory patients that tolerated treatment well but none of them benefited from Opdivo treatment. He believes this is due to patients having highly pre-treated, very advanced disease that progressed so rapidly they did not had time to receive enough Opdivo treatment to elicit an immune response and achieve clinical benefit. Therefore, he considers that Opdivo is more effective when used earlier. If it is used in 2nd line, where the patient does not have very advanced, highly refractory disease, there is more probability of achieving a clinical benefit. Also, this patient population potentially has a better immune system since has not received multiple lines of chemo that can compromise their immune function.",1458014400.0
"A TL shared the case of a NSCLC patient that developed new liver mets while receiving Opdivo treatment. Other than that, the patient is doing very well clinically, performance status is stable, and does not have any symptoms. He expressed these are the most difficult cases when trying to differentiate pseudoprogression from real progression. If there is only increased size of existing lesions and the patient is doing well, it is easier for him to consider pseudoprogression. When a patient develops new lesions, especially when there are several of them, but is doing well clinically and is tolerating treatment, it is more difficult for him to say it is pseudoprogression. Considers there is a high unmet need in performing research to identify objective tests that can be used to differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression.",1458014400.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter, when discussing 057 results, highlighted the lack of separation of the docetaxel and nivolumab OS curves during the first 6 months. Commented he has no clear explanation for this observation. Possible explanations hypothesized by him include delayed response of nivolumab, longer duration of response for nivolumab compared to docetaxel results in more patients alive in the long run, different disease with different biology compared to SQ NSCLC. Presenter also questioned why the early separation observed in the SQ NSCLC population was not seen in the NSQ population. Commented that has no clear explanation for this observation either. Stated that it is important to remember that SQ and NSQ NSCLC are different diseases that have been previously shown to respond differently to treatment.",1456462800.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico an Oncologist from Cuba discussed CIMAVax-EGF. It is a vaccine developed in Cuba composed of human recombinant EGF conjugated to the P64K recombinant protein from Neisseria meningitides as carrier. It is intended to elicit anti-EGF antibodies that are able to bind circulating EGF and prevent its binding to the EGFR. Works by stimulating the body's immune response by encouraging the body to make antibodies that recognize and bind to EGF. This stops the EGF attachment to receptors on cancer cells, so there is no signal telling the cancer cells to grow and divide. It is licensed in Cuba for use in adult patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line chemotherapy. In a Phase II controlled clinical trial (J Clin Oncol 26:1452-1458) designed to evaluate the survival effect of CIMAvax-EGF immunization in advanced stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line chemotherapy, vaccine group mean survival was 12.73 months (median, 6.47 months) vs. 8.52 months (median, 5.33 months) for the control arm. Adverse events were observed in less than 25% of cases and were grade 1 or 2. Most frequent AE were fever, headache, chills and pain at the injection site. Currently there is an agreement between the Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology to begin CIMAVax-EGF trials, which could lead to FDA approval. Oncologists that attended the symposium (both the program chairs and oncologists from the audience) showed lots of interest in the possibility of combining CIMAVax-EGF with nivolumab.",1456462800.0
At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter shared that that anecdotally he believes there is nivolumab activity in brain mets. He has seen activity in some of his patients. If a patient is symptomatic he treats the brain met first and then use an anti PD-1. He has seen additional benefit from the anti PD-1 beyond the one achieved by the first treatment administered for the brain met.,1456462800.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico there was a lot of discussion on how to distinguish pseudoprogression vs. true progression. Most agree that in patients with an increase in lesion size during treatment but clinically doing well they will continue treatment due to suspected pseudoprogression. There was less agreement regarding patients with new lesions during treatment: some believe that appearance of a new lesion is definitely a sign of true progression while others believe that a new lesion in a patient clinically doing well may also be pseudoprogression. The presenter commented that, in her opinion, appearance of a new lesion does not automatically means true progression. It can be an already existing lesion too small to be seen in radiographic images that, due to increased size after the immune response to treatment, it is now clinically detectable. Commented that she has seen this kind of response pattern and some patients can eventually respond to treatment. For the presenter, the most important thing to assess is how the patient is doing clinically. If the patient has clinical benefit and is tolerating treatment she will continue treatment even in the case of new lesions. But if the patient is clearly deteriorating (e.g. deterioration of performance status, worsening symptoms) this may indicate true progression. The presenter commented that clinical trials in Cuba allow treatment beyond initial progression if the patient has clinical benefit and is tolerating treatment.",1456462800.0
At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter shared that he always tests for PD-L1 but also treats non-expressors. He only uses PD-L1 test results to discuss with patients about probability of responding but not for treatment selection.,1456462800.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter, when discussing KEYNOTE 001 results, commented that pembrolizumab PFS and OS in treatment naive patients with high PD-L1 expression is very impressive.",1456462800.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico, when discussing KEYNOTE 001 results, discussed the OS Kaplan-Meier curves for both TPS ≥50% and all patients (TPS ≥1%) and highlighted that PD-L1 expression predicts benefit for pembrolizumab. Nevertheless, there was no mention of lack of statistically significant OS or PFS benefit vs. docetaxel in squamous patients. Also, there was no discussion regarding efficacy of 2 mg/kg vs. 10 mg/kg.",1456462800.0
"At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter commented it seems that treatment with tremelimumab has less irAEs, but the mechanism remains unclear.",1456462800.0
At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico the presenter commented that nivolumab monotherapy has very low grade 3/4 AEs. They are lower compared to ipilimumab monotherapy. Of note it appears that endocrine AEs are more frequent with anti PD-1s compared to ipilimumab. Also commented that both pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have a very similar AEs profile compared to nivolumab.,1456462800.0
"A TL commented that the main advantages of Opdivo that make it his 1st choice in 2nd line NSCLC are the OS benefit, no need to test for PD-L1, and very good safety profile.",1455253200.0
"During a joint meeting with Ken Hyland, TL shared that he had a lung patient with a CR to nivolumab. The CR was maintained for 1 year so TL together with the patient agreed to stop treatment. This patient continues to do well with no evidence of disease.",1472961600.0
"Regional TL is concerned about the impact of PD-1 agents in 1L with respect to ongoing trials. If 1L use occurs in a broader patient population and not the ~25% that would be high PD-L1+, recruitment for trials requiring Naive patients will become challenging.",1470974400.0
Regional TL is waiting to see the KN-024 data before deciding place in 1L. It will have to be a robust difference to use pembro over chemo. Also stated that he will follow the labeled indication when available. TL believes 50% PD-L1 cut point is cherry picking for best responders and 1% is too low for selection.,1470974400.0
"TL who is also a KN-021 investigator stated that his experience with chemo + pembro during the trial has blown him away. He recognizes that it is a small 'n' but has had 4-5 patients at his site complete the 2 years of treatment, stop therapy, and are continuing to do well.",1467172800.0
"Academic TL commented that the results from KN-024 will be practice changing. He was excited to hear that pembro was superior for both PFS and OS. He is awaiting the data, but stated that he would follow the -024 design and use pembro 1L only in patients with >50% PD-L1 expression. His use of PD-1 inhibitors 1L will be data driven; does not plan to utilize haphazardly.",1467172800.0
"During joint meeting with HSL Jamie Wong, SCLC NCCN chair shared that the panel will be adding nivolumab +/- ipilimumab to the NCCN guidelines as category 2A under subsequent therapy based on the -032 publication.",1466222400.0
Academic TL does not see benefit in testing for PD-L1; does not want to wait for test results to come back before initiating treatment. He assumed that nivolumab ORR would be similar to pembro at >50% PD-L1 cutoff. Reactively discussed data from -012 and TL stated the data confirms his assumption and supports his rationale not to test for PD-L1.,1466222400.0
"Community TL tests for ACTH, cortisol, TSH, T3, and T4 monthly to monitor for potential endocrinopathies. He stated that he has not experienced significant imAEs in his nivo patients.",1463112000.0
Community TL isn't testing for PD-L1 in 2L setting but this will change in 1L. He believes it will be very important to educate physicians as well as patients about PD-L1 and trial design differences once 1L data is available,1462507200.0
Community TL commented that he has used Opdivo in PS 2 patients and has not experienced safety concerns. Chemotherapy is not an option for these patients but TL is comfortable treating them with Opdivo.,1462507200.0
Community physician is requesting PD-L1 along with EGFR and ALK in newly diagnosed NSCLC patients. She prioritizes mutation status but also requests PD-L1 if enough tissue is available. Physician isn't using PD-L1 expression to inform treatment decisions and prefers nivo for 2L NSCLC patients.,1461729600.0
"Both a community and academic TL shared that they've been able to get payer approval for Nivo in SCLC, in some cases without providing the -032 data",1455598800.0
"Academic TL does not see value in PD-L1 as a biomarker for NSCLC and is not testing for PD-L1. Community oncologists have consulted him on which lab to use. His response is ""why are you testing?"" and explains rationale for not doing it.",1454994000.0
"Regional TL shared with me his thoughts on pseudoprogression
i.	Sees it in about 10% of patients
ii.	He said that serum tumor markers allow him to differentiate between real and pseudo progression
1.	This serum tumor marker allows for differentiation of pseudoprogression across multiple IO agents (durva, avelumab and nivo)",1457326800.0
"Academic lung TL voiced his opinions on the 209-026 data from ESMO: he said that the difference between 024 and 026 can only be explained by one of two things: a difference in the assay used to test for PDL1 or a difference in the drugs. He said that he thinks it is assay related. We discussed blueprint and he referenced a recent IASLC presentation that also showed concordance between the 22C3 and 28-8 antibodies. in contrast to Blueprint however, he has a paper submitted for review right now that shows 22C3 is more sensitive than 28-8 based on a 1% cut. He didnt provide too many details but it appears that he did a meta analysis on prior publication data and did not do any new tests for this publication. He said that they will develop their PDL1 test at their institution using a ventana system and the 22c3 antibody.",1477627200.0
"Academic lung TL voiced his opinions that the ""OAK data  is bad"". He said that it is clear that the assay used is not as good as the 22C3 or 28-8 based assays. He also said that he doesn't think much of the never smoker data in OAK.",1477627200.0
"Academic lung TL voiced his opinion that Keynote 024 and pembro first line ""is the single best thing that has ever happened in NSCLC for patients"".",1477627200.0
Academic lung TL voiced his opinions that he thinks that the use of pembro first line will not be limited to 50% and above only. He said that he has been able to get insurance to approve first line pembro in patients that test less than 50% before pembro was approved and he expects that will continue.,1477627200.0

"Regional lung TL told me the following information regarding his institutions biomarker testing in lung:He said they are sending the samples out to Clariet for PDL1 testing. He said they do get an actual percentage PDL1 positive back and it is based on the 22c3 antibody. He also said that foundation medicine is doing PDL1 testing. He said that overall, IHC is terrible for identifying which patients should get treated as it is entirely too subjective in nature and that management of tissue is becoming a complete nightmare as IHC requires sections and all the other tests being done also requires tissue.",1472788800.0
"Regional lung TL told me about a recent op-edd piece that he saw in either The New York Times or Wall Street Journal where someone (he suspects this person was from merck) wrote in and criticized oncologists about not using pembro in pdl1-. He said the piece basically called out the oncologists as being very dumb people. He said that it ""is typical Merck tactics"".",1472788800.0

"National lung TL volunteered the following about the 026 study:He said that it is all about patient selection. He said the 026 study failed because it is analogous to doing a trial of Tarceva in an unselected patient population. The agent (nivo) just doesn't work as well in unselected patients. PDL1 is the best biomarker we have right now, but it isn't perfect for many reasons.",1472788800.0

"National lung TL volunteered the following when asked by a audience member during an iplan about whether the 026 results mean physicians shouldn't treat PDL1- patients with nivo: he said ""No, this doesn't mean you shouldn't treat PDL1- patients"". He said remember that there is still about a 10% ORR in the PDL1- folks and the durability of responses in those patients is as good as in the PDL1+.",1472788800.0
Regional lung TL told me that the Merck people are telling him that 70% of 2nd line patients are getting tested for pdl1. He laughed and said he doesn't believe that.,1472788800.0
Regional lung TL told me that less than 50% of patients have enough tissue for staining at his institution. He said most patients are diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC via FNA.,1472788800.0
"Regional lung TL told me the data from 026 will probably actually help Merck because they will look at our more robust data set and interpolate that the same will happen with pembro. Example is if patient tests 30% PDL1+ first line, they wouldn't get P because they don't have data there but instead the doc can look at the 30% cut in 026 and say it looks like nivo will work so I assume pembro will work too.",1472788800.0
"Regional lung TL said that combo ipi plus nivo will have to be much higher OS than single agent pembro for docs to even consider using it since it will be more toxic than single agent pembro. He said showing an ORR benefit over pembro won't matter, it must be OS benefit.",1471320000.0
"Regional lung TL said that he ""doesn't think there is ultimately any difference between nivo and pembro even with 026 press release"". He is impressed that pembro hit both pfs and OS data. He said BMS gambled right for second line but not so much for 1st line. He also said that it's clear that PDL1 positive patients do better. ""It always better to be PDL1 positive"". He wants to see the data from pembro and from 026 to really see if there is any difference.",1471320000.0
"Regional lung TL said that he is surprised that insurers are not denying pembro for any patients thus far in second line but it will most likely change in first line. This is in reference to PDL1 positivity and how positive it must be. He said that insurers are not requiring 50% for coverage, just so long as it is PDL1+ of any amount.",1471320000.0
Regional lung TL said that he has had some patients re-respond to nivo after rechallenge and those patients didn't have recurrent toxicity. He said that they were dc'ed due to toxicity and then were restarted on nivo months later.,1471320000.0

Regional lung TL told me that he has had Foundation Medicine mutational load testing done on 30-40 of his NSCLC patients and thus far he has not seen any kind of correlation of nivo responses in those patients that have high mutation rates. He said he was surprised by that and expected to see more responses in the high mutation load patients. He also commented that he has seen patients with high mutation load not do very well on platinum doublets either.,1470369600.0
"Regional lung TL told me that he doesn't particularly like the design of the RTOG 3505 study in terms of the chemotherapy used. He said he understands why taxanes were avoided (potential for higher rates/grade pneumonitis with nivo) but he said ""cis etoposide is a bad drug"" .",1470369600.0
Regional lung TL told me he has seen higher rates of pneumonitis in his nivo patients if they have had prior radiation.,1470369600.0
Regional lung TL told me he heard about the 026 press release and said that we now need to know if nivo can be effective in patients that fail first line pembro.

"Regional lung TL told me that Merck was smart in only testing pembro in PDL1+ (50%) patients. He said the data always looks better in that enriched group. He said he isn't sure whether insurers will require PDL1+ > 50% to use pembro (i.e the 50% number might not be needed, it could just be plus or minus at 1% or 5%, etc) . He said he has had success in getting a 1st line NSCLC patient pembro without having to provide the % PDL1 positive.

"National lung TL commented that given that we have shown efficacy of nivo single agent in late line squamous patients (063 data), there is some rationale to use docetaxol plus ramu for some select second line squamous patients before trying nivo. He said that if they ""save"" docetaxol plus ramu for later line, the patient may not get a chance to receive that regimen as they may be too symptomatic by then. When I asked him which patients, he said the very fit patients might be candidates but he said that this is ultimately a very small subset of patients that they would seriously think of docetaxol plus ramu before nivo. He said that the tox profile for docetaxol plus ramu is a concern.",1462248000.0
"National lung TL stated that the more important information regarding PFS with nivo is the ""right side of the curve"" (i.e. the tail of the curve)  instead of mPFS. He said that the ""nonsquamous NSCLC population is such a heterogeneous population of patients that includes never smokers, EGFR mutants, etc that we know are not the best responders to IO which is probably why the mPFS is numerically higher for docetaxol vs nivo"". He again said we need to focus on the right side of the curve.",1462248000.0

"Regional lung TL estimates that he has probably treated a total of 40 patients with nivo thus far. He estimates that he has seen about a 20-25%ORR and about a 25% SD rate. He said that when he explains to patients the chances of the drug working for them, he refers to about a 50% chance of it working (he combines the ORR with the SD rates to get about 50%) instead of only telling them they have a 1 in 5 chance (since ORR is about 20%).",1461297600.0

d.	She said she doesn't see much difference between pembro and nivo efficacy or tox wise but the Q2 vs Q3 is still an issue. She did say that when patients complain about Q2 and having to come to the cancer center every 2 weeks, she just tells them ""too bad, that's what you have to do with this drug"".

"The Opdivo H&N indication and -026 data were reviewed during a clinical update to a large national PBM.  With regards to H&N, the customer had very little feedback and expressed that they were not surprised to see Opdivo demonstrate clinical benefit given the impressive results observed in the clinical studies in the other tumor types.  With regards to the -026 study, the customer felt that the lack of differential results were largely due to the number of patients with low PD-L1 expression.

Because the AIM pathways are entirely closed and have no contact with manufacturers, it is unknown if the 1L Keytruda data has been reviewed therefore the reasoning behind the lack of Keytruda's inclusion in 1L in the AIM pathway is unclear at this time.",1480654800.0

Upon examination of their data, little, of any, utilization of the 10mg/kg dose has been observed.  As a result, Keytruda placement in the pathway is expected to be reexamined.

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

"I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ""require"" say 220.  He said ""Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.""   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ""close"" the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck's different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)…He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line…Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab",1466740800.0

-	Happy to see that ""we now have a very clear offer for very specific patient population (RE: PDL1 > 50%)""
-	Shared that panelist would NOT recommend the use of pembro for patients who are below the 50% expression level
-	Raised the question about the need ""re-test"" patients in 2L even if they were tested in 1L. Her rational was to be also more selective in 2L and not to use agents who have no approval / no data for low PDL1 expression. This comment was more about pembro in 2L.  
-	Asked what data we was recently presented in lung cancer with nivo

"We need better categories for insights for HEOR and access.

At a conference for a large Oncology Network in the US, we witnessed the transformation of payment for care in Oncology.  Of 14 applied sites, 13 regional sites for this network of 1600 Oncology providers were accepted into the Medicare pilot - oncology care model -OCM.  That will be 32,000 oncology patients and 800 providers working with Medicare on a bundled care model.  For instance, one regional site recently accepted within the OCM now has an astounding 79% of its revenue coming from bundled payment models.

The way the OCM will be operationalized by this group is as follows:  Go live date is 7/1/2016.  The patient waterfall into the OCM is:  All Medicare patients > OCM candidates >  1st treatment = OCM Patients.  Any cancer, any patient currently undergoing treatment or new patients.  Then there are OCM expectations:  1) Identify patients 2) Use Institute of Medicine treatment plan: a) What is the diagnosis?  b) what is the goal of therapy (e.g. cure, tumor shrink prior to surgery, tx after surgery, life extension, QoL) c) Treatment plan d) social work e) 24/7 access to care, f) prognosis, etc.. The aim is to improve patient quality of care and save money.  

Providers expect to meet daily to discuss the OCM patients (team huddle), they set expectations with patients to call before going to ER, or reaching out to ER to prevent unnecessary tests.  This is a big ask for providers, and IT systems to track.

"Began the session with a brief overview of NSCLC and its histologies.  Brief overview of general 1L therapies, and asked the question of what to do next.  The consensus was that immunotherapy is preferred over all other alternatives.  Checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionizing therapy, across histologies and other cancer diagnoses.  Gave great overviews of 017 and 057.  Both were clearly head and shoulders above the standards.  017 indicated that we don't have a good biomarker available for testing, so all-comers strategy worked.  057 showed that PDL1 testing may benefit, but still not really clear.  Everyone essentially benefitted, regardless of expression.  Keynote-001 was a mess of a study.  Her words, not mine.  Pembro did show benefit, but not clear at what dose, what expression level, etc.  Additionally, it was not a Phase 3 trial, so tough to say.  Definitely has anti-tumor activity and an acceptable AE profile, but would choose Nivo over Pembro in NSCLC.  Biomarkers need to be investigated further.  Something else is going on in the tumor microenvironment, so PDL1 is not ready for prime time.  The 2nd part of the session was referring to targeted therapy.  Nothing eye-opening here, just that the addition of agents increases the chances of AE's, without substantially increasing OS.  The moral of the story is that we have a lot of options in NSCLC.

"Regional lung TL shared that recently he had been noticing at his institution more of the medical oncologists have been testing for PDL1, however not in the setting to determine treatment options during metastatic disease but has been ""thrown in"" during initial tests for patients that are presenting with earlier stages of disease",1461816000.0
"In regards to the differences of the PDL1 +/- curves for squamous NSCLC vs. non-squamous NSCLC, a regional lung TL commented that although he knew PDL1 expression ""plays out"" differently in other tumor types (referenced renal), he felt the differences between the squam and nonsquam had nothing to do with the histology or potential biology within the tumor type but rather the chemo (docetaxel) arm in -017 did not perform as well as it should, therefore the PDL1- patients in the squam ""appear"" to have a larger benefit - ""it is all about the comparator""",1461816000.0

Regional lung TL feels that it is more difficult to distinguish pseduoprogression in NSCLC than for oncologists treating melanoma patients,1461816000.0
"Regional lung TL stated that he likely would not feel comfortable making a treatment decision for subsequent lines of therapy based on a PDL1 expression level that was taken prior to the patient's (first or) most recent line of therapy  - he would not ""trust"" this and would feel more comfortable measuring the PDL1 status again following the patient's most recent line of therapy as the expression level can change over time",1461816000.0

"TL voluntarily shared that his experience with nivo is that it is extremely well-tolerated - almost so much so he finds himself ""forgetting"" that imAEs can occur with the agent",1458187200.0
TL stated that he would be comfortable using nivo in PS 2 patients with NSCLC,1458187200.0
"In speaking to the requirement for PDL1 expression for use of pembro, TL voluntarily shared ""it would be different if pembro was more efficacious than nivo, but with similar efficacy, choosing nivo becomes a no-brainer since you do not have to test""",1458187200.0
Community TL expressed that a huge unmet need where they feel nivolumab could play a role would be in the adjuvant NSCLC population,1456722000.0
"RTL feels as soon as the combo of ipi+nivo is approved in the 1L NSCLC setting, his go-to treatment regimen for most patients (with curative intent) would be to give RT + ipi concurrently followed by ipi + nivo after the completion of radiation - he feels with time and more experience the oncology community will learn to better manage any of the imAEs that might arise with combo therapy",1478494800.0
"Regional lung TL stated that his plan of action for non-sq lung patients is to test all for PDL1 expression and start nivolumab while waiting for the results. If they come back above the 50% threshold of positivity, he would switch them to pembro; if less than 50% keep them on nivolumab. He has yet to find anyone that has had a >50% PDL1 IHC result.",1457067600.0
"Regional lung TL stated the opinion that concurrent combination of nivo with chemotherapy in lung cancer is not the right strategy given the negative effect chemo might have on immune cell potentiation/activity, but that the 370 study trial addressing the role of nivo as a maintenance therapy following chemotherapy is the smartest study BMS has done yet and should ultimately identify the most appropriate place for immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer.",1457067600.0
"Local TL focused on lung commented that given the new data available with pembro it would now be unethical to not test for PDL1 for 1L treatment decision making. He added that despite a rather high volume of NSCLC, he's yet to see anyone express greater than 50% and feels the true number of high expressors must be much less than the 25-30% Merck has in their studies.",1479013200.0
LTL expressed surprise that BMS has presented I/O combo 1L data so many times now but will likely still get beat to market by others looking at this strategy. He feels that while BMS started out in the lead on lung they're slowly getting passed by now with atezo in a good position with dosing convenience for 2L and 1L competition coming at them from many I/O products across several companies.,1478404800.0
"Local lung TL commented that while the neoadjuvant data from ESMO was from a very small set of patients, he considered it to be very promising and will likely be a low bar to beat going against chemotherapy in that setting.",1476331200.0
"Local lung TL expressed that he was surprised to see BMS stock get hit so hard basically for having one negative study. After seeing the data, he commented that many drugs in the past have had similar results that were considered a win, referring to equivalent efficacy to control with improvement in toxicity. He considered much of what the media has been saying to be an over-reaction to the data.",1476331200.0
A lung RTL commented that as the data keeps evolving he is starting to be more selective with which patients receive Opdivo. For patients that are PDL1 negative and have a notably low tumor mutation burden he's beginning to use the cyramza/docetaxel combination 2nd line given the higher response rate seen vs. the 9% that is reported in PDL1 negative pts from 057. He feels that he can always reserve nivo for 3L if pts fail this regimen. He did note it is quite toxic so he wouldn't use this approach with everyone but at least in those that could tolerate it in order to give them more overall treatment options.,1475640000.0
"Regarding the recent negative press around 026, several nurses from a high volume practice commented that in the majority of cases, patients will always trust the decisions and guidance of their oncologist far before they would listen to any media report and that, given the wide usage of Opdivo across tumor types at this point, they don't anticipate any significant changes in the practice because of one study that wound up reading out negative.",1472702400.0
Regional lung TL commented that the 026 news wasn't all that surprising given that PFS advantage is an extremely lofty goal to hit with immunotherapy vs. well established chemotherapy regimens in 1L disease. He does feel toxicity benefit will fall on the side of Opdivo but that 1L usage of platinum doublet will be tough to give up without very compelling data in the 1L setting. He fears that you may be losing that option if you don't use it up front.,1472702400.0
"National lung TL commented that ROVA-T and ipi/nivo appear to be the most promising potential agents in SCLC. Regarding ORR reported for ipi/nivo, he mentioned that this is likely not the best outcome for I/O in general but that duration of response or even maintaining stable disease (duration of disease control) should be considered as more important measures of activity.",1467950400.0
"Regional TL from academic site informed me that the institution VA has a pathway in place (completely internally developed) stating that if NSCLC pts test positive for PDL1 they should be using pembro based on the ""superiority of their data"" in this population while any PDL1 non-expressors should be given nivolumab. He noted that this is not a pathway that's in place for patients treated outside of the VA at this institution.",1461902400.0
"High disease burden TL expressed the opinion that it may not be altogether appropriate to treat all lung patients with Opdivo based on the PDL1 data available. He feels that if we'll ultimately be making treatment decisions in the front line based on PDL1 status, we should probably strongly consider its role in later line therapy as well.",1461297600.0
"Met with Dir of Utilization Management with national Oncology Pathways org in reaction to 026 release.  Questions addressed were around PD-L1 cutoffs and results from those.

- Presented an overview of 026 and 024- compare and contrast, etc.  h accepted this information very well and did not seem concerned about Opdivo's continued value, given the extensive experience we now have with Opdivo.  Knew little about Tecentriq.  
- Discussed Keytruda and impact of 1L approval. Discussed the relatively small number of overall NSCLC pts that would ""qualify"" for Keytruda in first line. No questions there.
- Briefly discussed other OP trials and regimen work.
- Their organization is interested in working with IBM's Watson; interested in modeling various economics, etc, around Oncology practices, given OCM and other payment changes.  mentioned a growing number of the patients they are exposed to through their contracts, are in value-based payment designs.

Among the insights and dialogue during the meeting:
•	Dr. said that their customers were calling him very quickly after 026 results were announced.  High level of interest.
•	KT explained trial design and went over approved talking points
•	Explained that we are continuing multiple lung trials, including other 1st line trials
•	Explained that more info forthcoming after deep dive into results of 026
•	Reminded Dr. that this trial actually begins to answer some of his early questions he had around nivo and NSCLC, re: predictability around response, efficacy and adverse event predictability.  We continue to learn more about I/O therapy, and specifically PD-1 inhibitors
•	Reminded Dr. of nivo's efficacy and safety in 017 and 057 across negative and positive pts, and Keytruda label. He agreed that we are still learning about PD-L1 + and - , and impact
•	Discussed our earlier call with Dr.  re: 026, and his request for us to get more questions from Pharmacy perspective if Long had any
•	Reviewed same information with Long that we had done earlier with Dr.
•	PharmD commented on the failed BMS trial and that this will probably be ""good news for Keytruda"".  KT briefly explained that there were differences in their 1st L study compared to 026
•	Asked whether BMS is pursuing any other trials in 1L lung
•	Personal thought was that when the PD-1 inh hit the 1L lung space that they will be limited to a defined population and not an all-comer indication like in the 2L with Opdivo
•	Responding to KT's question around utilization management by pathways org with NSCLC patients,  the PA (prior auth) asks if the patient has had a PD-L1 test and categorizes into ""positive, negative, or unknown."" No expression level is known unless it is submitted.  Currently pathways org is NOT requesting expression level.
•	NCCN guideline/compendia indication will lead to approval but may not count towards credit on the pathway
o	Pathways also incorporate cost into the equation and even though they may have the listing it may not be included in the pathway based on cost analysis. Previous discussions around this have indicated that payer influence is very impactful in this area.
•	Customers/payers/IDN's have no input or influence into the pathway decision.  NO representation on committees, etc. by employees of their customers.
o	The pathway advisors will make up the decision",1470888000.0

At this time we discussed the ORR across all patient populations in the trial, focusing on the >1% and >5% populations, as well as the safety profile from the 012. We discussed traditional response rates with SOC agents in the first line, focusing on platinum doublet chemo, and the toxicities associated with these agents. AS he believes nivolumab to be a very safe drug in the second line, he was impressed to see the safety profile with the regimen combination, particularly discontinuation rates, being similar across the arms of the study. However, throughout the discussion he mentioned several times the fact that this is a phase 1 trial with very small numbers. At this point we discussed how the NCCN panels view data, highlighting that in the past they have considered adding agents to the guidelines based on P1 data in small patient populations.

"During a recent meeting with a lung cancer AI, the topic of PD-1 inhibitors in 1L was addressed in the context of CM-026 and KN-024. 
This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn't given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.",1473825600.0
"Ann Saylors and I met with a NTL/ former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave the position to a junior RadOnc faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center in the Southeast region who volunteered these insights regarding the implications of the BMS NSCLC and SCLC data presented at ASCO:

NSCLC:
•	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
	Doesn't believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn't see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
•	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there's no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won't reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
•	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
•	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms
•	Doesn't want one bad experience to tarnish an oncologist's perception of regimen",1468468800.0
"Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
•	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company's therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
•	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck's and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
•	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck's most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
•	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
•	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
•	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can't be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
•	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn't fully explain disease outcome
	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn't believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
•	Doesn't believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
•	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer's expenses 
•	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group's opinion
•	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they've done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro's required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn't need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
•	This panelist says that Nivo's introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ""financially toxic"" to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
•	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari's article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)",1468468800.0
"A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  •	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  •	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn't seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  •	Doesn't think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  •	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  •	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma's NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  •	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  •	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  •	Hadn't heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn't see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool's irrelevance",1460692800.0
"A RTL/ AI/ former-NCCN board member shared the following unsolicited insight regarding Opdivo in NSCLC versus our competitor:
He mentioned that Opdivo is currently winning overall in lung because of our competitor's need to test in order to treat. However, once Opdivo and its competitor move to first line (where testing is essentially implied), our advantage will disappear and their dose scheduling benefit of q3w versus q2w will be the predominant advantage.
He believes that both q3w and q2w dosing may be more medication than needed, and that if Opdivo strives to regain the upper hand, BMS should consider q4w dosing, as he'd just read an article about q4 dosing of Opdivo in a GBM study.",1456462800.0

Apparently, Genetech is currently providing a discount with several large community privately owned accounts across the nation, as well as a rebate similar to ours.  What they offer is as follows:
 
1)      1% rebate through McKesson (similar to our contract) for all infusible products (Tecentriq was included in this when approved for bladder cancer).
2)      In addition to the 1% rebate for all customers, for the large community private accounts, they are also offering an upfront discount of 4.3% + ASP.  It is not performance based (no growth or volume component) and is adjusted quarterly based on ASP.

TL said that the data from Hodi's ASCO'16 poster from CM-069 will be helpful in educating colleagues that steroid used to treat irAE's don't diminish the tumor response to Ipi+Nivo Regimen.
However, TL said that similar data for Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC would be even more impactful. The perception of irAE's on Nivo are less severe than when on Regimen.

However, HCP noted a sharp rise in CEA tumor marker. CEA levels went up to ""1000"" and remained high for at least two months, before starting to decline again.  During these fluctuations in CEA, the tumor continued to respond and patient PS remained good.

HCP commented that CEA is not generally thought to be a great marker for NSCLC. So they didn't use CEA levels to make treatment decision. However, the large disconnect between CEA levels and clinical response was interesting.

We discussed the possibility that CEA could be released from dying tumor cells, which would result in correlation of CEA levels with tumor shrinkage, as was observed.",1462248000.0

NTL spent proportionally more time presenting Nivo data. Just one slide of Pembro data.  NTL highlighted the robustness BMS phase III clinical trial design, improvement in OS vs SOC.  NTL also pointed out Merck's departure from the norm (i.e. using a Phase1 for more than just dose optimization), and stated that Pembro data in NSCLC are just more confusing than the Nivo data.

NTL also stated belief that PDL1 expression is not useful for predicting patient outcomes or making treatment decisions, at least in the second line.  While the academic institution is testing for PDL1, it is mainly for research purposes.

After the presentation, in a private 1:1 discussion, NTL shared that she doesn't understand how the FDA approved Pembro for NSCLC at 2mg/kg Q3W. based on such a small amount of data at that dose and schedule.",1461729600.0
"Changing perceptions of PDL1 biomarker in NSCLC1:

Back in October '15, NTL initially came out strongly in favor of PDL1 testing, with the intention of treating only PDL1 positive patients with Pembro.  NTL quickly softened that view, to the point of being unsure about whether he would treat PDL1negative patients with a PD1 agent. 

Fast-forward to April '16: NTL now is routinely prescribing Nivo for 2L NSCLC without testing for PDL1.

This shift in thinking & practice is based upon:
1) Realization that PDL1-negative tumors can respond just as well as PDL1+ tumors.
2) Belief that many patients progressing to a 2L Tx don't have the time to wait for PDL1 results to come back.   ""You don't want to break-stride between 1L and 2L treatment"".
3) Q2w vs Q3W dosing no longer a factor because NTL is starting to switch patients to Q3W dosing of Nivo (3mg/kg) if that patient shows a PR or CR on initial Q2W dosing.  So far TL is not seeing any detriment to that shift in dosing part way through treatment.  NTL would like to see data on whether he could stop Tx completely in those good responders but is not willing to try that until data suggest that is reasonable. (NTL freely admits that his decision to shift to Q3W dosing of Nivo isn't evidence-based either!)",1460088000.0

RTL believes some oncologists wait too long to treat NSCLC patients with Nivo, reserving it as the last-ditch therapy after all other therapies have failed. He thinks this is a terrible idea, because those patients at later lines of therapy often don't have the time to wait for the immune system to kick-in.

"A Lung RTL told me that ""BMS was too aggressive with the -026 trial and its endpoints and is paying the price""  The TL then softened his stance and speculated that the Squamous population might do better on 1st line Nivo as opposed to chemo.  The TL added that he has written Nivo off-label for a few 1st line Squamous patients and ""got excellent results""",1471752000.0
A Lung RTL told me he was disappointed by the recent news for Checkmate -026 but also not very surprised.  He feels the future for 1st line therapy is the combination of PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 drug and that they will be the standard in about one year.  He did say that a patient told him the news of -026 and the patients perspective was Opdivo doesn't work at all.  The TL also recommended BMS stop the DTC messaging in the short term,1471147200.0
"A Lung TL told me he would like to see a breakdown of the Nivo -026 data.  The TL feels that OS may prove positive in the end but suggested that feels the data may prove similar efficacy but better tolerability.

"A study team at a SWOG site shared with me the new study schema for SWOG 1400 multi arm trial in Squamous NSCLC.  The mutation study arms will no longer include an arm randomizing between the targeted drug and docetaxel.  For patients with no targetable mutation, they will be randomized to an Immunotherapy arm of either Nivolumab alone 3mg/Kg every 2 weeks or the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.  The dosing for the combo is that from 209-227 with Ipilimumab at 1mg/Kg every 6 weeks.  Dosing for  Nivo will be over 30 minutes and for Ipilimumab over 60 minutes.  The trial schema did show an earlier arm for AZN Durvalumab.  The study team said that arm was closed and added ""we heard it didn't work out to well""",1462075200.0
A Lung RTL told me he has in a few cases continued Opdivo for Grade 1-2 toxicities with the addition of low doses of oral steroids.  He commented that the adverse even resolved with no apparent loss of anti-tumor actiivity.  He also said he has consulted his colleagues and the local consensus is that Opivo drug holds can be lifted when the steroid dose has been tapered to 20 mg daily.  The TL has put this into practice and in a few cases with no adverse outcomes.,1462075200.0
A Community TL told me he has used Opdivo in several patients with ECOG Performance Status of 2-3 (KPS as low as 50) with no safety issues and several patients have achieved clinical objective responses.  The TL now feels that Opdivo can be given to lung patients even he previously would have never considered giving chemotherapy too,1462075200.0
A community TL asked me about using PET scanning for patients on Opdivo treatment.  I noted the possible issues with infiltrating T-cells picking up the PET tracer.  The TL told me he recently obtained a PET scan on a patient who achieved a Partial Objective Response after 6 months of therapy.  He stated that the scan was positive at the site on the largest lesion remaining in the thoracic cavity but the PET uptake was confined to the core of the lesion.  The TL was interpreting the scan to show that the tumor was being eroded away by the patient's  Immune system,1460865600.0
"A lung RTL from MD showed me some data that she has accumulated from Immunotherapy trials from 3 sites categorizing the radiologic findings of patients with suspected pneumonitis.  She has noted several cases where radiology was reporting disease progression due the appearance of new spherical lesions that bronchcoscopy later revealed were in fact entirely immune cells.  These patients all responded to coricosteroids and the ""new"" lesions disappeared upon subsequent scans.  The TL highlighted the need that getting a pulmonary consult and a bronchoscopy should be done routinely",1457845200.0
"A TL at a large community center in MD mentioned that she was the PI on the Keynote 001 trial at her site.   Screened 25 patients, enrolled 6 due to the >50% PD-L1+ cutoff.

TL also pointed out she has no information on the Merck assistance programs since to date she has never had a Merck rep ask to meet with her",1457845200.0
"A community TL from MD volunteered that she recently prescribed Opdivo for a NSCLC patient.  She initially suspected the patient might be experiencing pseudoprogression since the 1st scans showed only a moderate increase in several thoracic lesions and the patient claimed a slight increase in performance status.  TL was aware of the criteria for establishing pseudoprogression so treated with 3 more cycles of Opdivo.  Patient then began to complain of increased pain.  Second set of scans revealed further tumor progression.  TL sent tumor off to Foundation for molecular testing.  While waiting for results, the TL ordered that a painful lesion on the 7th rib get radiation (cyberknife).  The results from Foundation revealed 3 weeks later a targetable lesion.  When the patient was brought back in for new baseline scans, they showed all thoracic lesions (RT and non-RT) had disappeared.",1457845200.0
"A lung RTL from MD noted that based on findings of a retrospective review of patients getting a PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy, they have noted several cases (n=5) where the patient had documented immune mediated pneumonitis that did not respond to steroids and also did not respond to subsequent treatment with Infliximab.  The TL would like to see more studies on this but suggested that another agent like mycophenolate be tried instead.",1457845200.0
"Lung TL with extensive Opdivo experience but no prior experience with Merck or Roche today for first time openly discussed the proposed benefit of an Anti-PD-L1 from AstraZeneca with regard to minimal pulmonary toxicity (no blockage of PD-L2).  Suggests to me that AZ has begun looking to influence the investigators at its trial sites that their I-O drug combination is superior from the Opdivo-Yervoy regimen.  When I showed him the data from -012, he noted that BMS combo still has some low level pneumonitis and he believes that the AZ combo will have none",1456635600.0

"Lung NTL who is at a -370 site said that part of the reason the enrollment has been difficult is that ""maintenance is a difficult entry point.""  He means that it's difficult to take patients off a treatment if it's working (i.e. platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) to move them to maintenance with a different agent. He also echoed concerns about patients already having most of the options available to them and not wanting to be randomized to something they don't want.",1473739200.0
"NTL said that while he's glad BMS is designing clinical trials aimed at answering questions like ""when can patients be discontinued?"", he doesn't feel that -153 will be able to answer the question.

In particular, he cites that he would expect there won't be much follow up data from the discontinuation arm as patients withdrawal following the completion of treatment.",1473652800.0
"Several lung TLs mentioned that the Q4W dosing in -384 could have very significant impact on prescribing habits, giving Opdivo a significant advantage over Keytruda. One NTL said he would want to do 480 mg flat Q4W dosing immediately without any Q2W or Q3W lead-in phase.",1473652800.0

"RTL expects Pembro will have 40+% ORR in patient population with 50+% PD-L1 expression. He therefore doesn't see any reason to use PBDC in that population. In his experience, he agrees with estimates that 25-30% of his 1L patients will have 50+% PD-L1 expression. He would not consider using anti-PD-1 treatment in patients who don't meet 50% PD-L1 expression cut-off.",1473480000.0
"RTL said that she did not expect KN-024 data to have much impact on treatment of first-line NSCLC, as her experience has demonstrated that fewer than 20% of patients have 50+% PD-L1 expression. 

However, she does think KN-024 will have a significant impact in making PD-L1 testing routine in 1L NSCLC.",1473220800.0
"RTL feels that since platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is relatively effective and that physicians now have a lot of experience in using PBDC first-line followed by anti-PD-1, she expects this treatment paradigm to continue for the foreseeable future, and not to be disrupted by KN-024.",1473220800.0

"NTL said he has not treated a single patient with immunotherapy who experienced pseudo-progression. However, he has treated around 10 patients (out of 80+ total) with immunotherapy who have had ""mixed"" responses where some tumors demonstrate response and others do not. He contrasted this with prior 30 years of treatment experience where he never saw a ""mixed"" response. The NTL thinks the field needs to make more of an effort to understand this phenomenon.",1472011200.0
"After talking to many National and Regional TLs the past few weeks, all feel that Opdivo and Keytruda are clinically similar, and that the different outcomes in KN-024 and CM-026 were strictly the result of PD-L1 cutoff levels.

Additionally, consensus among this group that Ipi + Nivo will be more efficacious with strong possibility of becoming SOC in 1st-line NSCLC.",1471752000.0
"RTL feels that Keytruda will be able to dominate all anti-PD-1 monotherapy 1L NSCLC market, even for patients with PD-L1 expression less than 50%. She feels physicians will still use it for patients with lower PD-L1 expression, and that insurance will likely cover.",1471752000.0
"RTL who is participating in AZ's NEPTUNE study feels that the Checkmate-227 dosing schedule is much more attractive to patients, and that our anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1 combination regimen will become SOC in 1st-line lung.

"Citing data across tumor types, an NTL said there doesn't appear to be much of an effect of previous lines of therapy (i.e. prior chemo) on the efficacy of immunotherapy agents. However, IT does seem to increase response to subsequent chemo. As such, he would be strongly predisposed to incorporate IT agents into patient treatment as early as possible. He did say that 1st-line Opdivo monotherapy might not make sense for patients with low PD-L1 expression, but demurred from citing a specfic PD-L1 expression level at which he'd prefer anti-PD-1 versus chemo.",1468641600.0
"Lung RTL described how lung cancer has multiple subpopulations with different etiologies (e.g. smoker vs. driver mutation) and tumor characteristics.

"In discussing -012 data, lung NTL said that there was a ""reasonably high"" rate of Grade 3/4 toxicity, but with reduced TRAEs. He questioned whether the reduced rate of TRAEs will hold in the community setting where lung cancer doctors have less experience with Ipi. He also said the efficacy was ""promising,"" but felt that it was reliant on patient selection, with the benefit mostly seen in patients with high PD-L1 expression. Similarly, he had questions over why the efficacy stratified by PD-L1 was so different from what was seen in the AZ study.",1466913600.0
"In discussing PD-L1 cutoffs in the first-line setting, lung NTL said he feels that clinical trials with anything less than 25% PD-L1 expression is ""risky"" for the cutoff point for patient inclusion.

We discussed the importance of including as many patients as possible, which he acknowledged.",1466913600.0
"Lung RTL believes AZ will have long-term advantage in that- if NEPTUNE reads out well- they'll be ""PDL1 agnostic"" in that they'll be able to provide treatment paradigm in which MEDI4736 can be used for PDL1+ patients, and Tremelimumab + MEDI can be used in PDL1- patients.",1462334400.0
"Lung RTL who is well-versed on all relevant data believes differentiation from Merck will be based almost exclusively on how well we're able to deliver message that PDL1 expression is dynamic (and that testing is therefore inherently unreliable). He shared that PDL1 testing has become much easier recently, and is no longer a significant barrier. He feels Merck will push more into liquid biopsies, and in expressing the message that even if PDL1 expression is dynamic, it doesn't change enough to alter physician treatment approach.",1462334400.0
Lung RTL is beginning a Merck Phase 2 trial with combination of Keytruda and anti-EphB4 soluble receptor molecule in the treatment of 2nd-line NSCLC. These patients will have progressed from chemo in the 1st-line as part of AZ's NEPTUNE study (patients in IO arm will instead go to our FRACTION studies). Merck recently opened a similar study looking at Keytruda + anti-EphB4 in urothelial cancer. EphB4 blockade has been shown in pre-clinical models to both decrease angiogenesis and increase T cell trafficking to site of tumor.,1462334400.0

"In discussing Keynote-010 data, LTL was already well aware of its limitations, and shared that she felt that was true for her colleagues as well. She felt the way 2 vs. 10 mg/kg data was presented was intentionally misleading. Regardless of Pembro TPS cut-off, she always uses Nivo in lung cancer due to lack of testing requirement.",1460174400.0
"TL expressed belief that biomarker (mostly PDL1) testing will have drastically different implications and utility in different tumor types. She currently does PDL1 testing in all possible lung cancer patients, but doesn't use it to guide clinical decision making. She feels PDL1 expression levels (both by tumor and immune cells) will be more important in deciding treatments for ovarian and bladder cancer.",1458187200.0
"TL discussed practical limitations of PDL1 testing in lung cancer. First, most of the tissue is used for mutational testing, which is higher priority. Second, many of her patients have COPD, which makes it difficult to collect biopsy tissue. In those patients, she is still able to get mutational status using bone biopsy, but not PDL1 expression levels.",1458187200.0
"In a national webcast, lung NTL explained her approach to PDL1 testing in NSCLC patients. For 2nd-line, she almost never does PDL1 testing due to availability of Opdivo. The exception is Alk/EGFR mutant patients, for whom she feels the anti-PD1 data is less compelling in PDL1- patients. In those patients, she thinks it's warranted to do PDL1 testing, and treat with an anti-PD1 only if PDL1+ (she didn't mention positivity threshold). 
In 1st-line NSCLC, she feels she will do testing for PDL1 when anti-PD1 agents are available. Her reasoning is that, in PDL1- patients, anti-PD1 therapy might not be much better than platinum-based doublet chemo. As such, it will be more important to identify appropriate patients for anti-PD1 therapy.",1457413200.0
"LTL ambivalent about PDL1 testing for lung cancer patients. He mentioned that liquid biopsy would be very helpful in the future, given how it's less invasive and more timely.

"LTL expressed exasperation about correct way to use PDL1 status to guide treatment. He said that in addition to the inherent difficulties with tumor heterogeneity and dynamism, he feels overwhelmed by the different assays from different companies.

He believes Merck might have an advantage in this regard given ""more experience"" testing due to label requirement.",1457154000.0
"Not specific to NSCLC patients. A provider at a VA hospital in Hawaii said that 10 out of 15 patients treated with Opdivo +/- Yervoy have experienced significant endocrinopathies.

Notably, they reported that other AEs (hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, etc.) weren't commonly seen. They inquired whether there might be hypersensitivity in certain populations (although they were unable to identify a clear ""population"" in this scenario).",1466049600.0
"NTL is a skeptic of combination therapy in the treatment of lung cancer. He doesn't understand the rationale for the approach of using a combination approach when one of those agents has already failed (e.g. Ipi + Nivo in a patient who has already progressed on Nivo). He says that approach doesn't have historical basis in the treatment of oncology. He thinks the ""efficacy"" seen in -012 can largely be attributed to patient selection.

As a result, he feels there might be a sustained (3-5 years) period of anti-PD-1 monotherapy in 1L NSCLC. He thinks clinical trials should be designed to address that landscape (e.g. how to treat patients who progress on 1L anti-PD-1 treatment).",1473739200.0
"RTL who was an investigator on -012 said he feels our anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1 dosing regimen is preferable to other similar regimens (i.e. NEPTUNE).

Patient wants to live longer, have QOL instead of live longer, etc).
o	Should be online in 6m.  
o	This is a 2nd version.
o	Then the tool will tell you what treatment an expert panel (comprised of national and international lung experts) would recommend as the best treatment or treatment choices (recommendations from 6 experts).  This is an algorithm driven response system.  
o	Then allows the provider to enter what treatment he/she would select
o	AI says will be free online
o	This tool does not take into account cost/value of meds, and actually is cost agnostic.
•	AI has interest in value/cost of oncology meds.  
o	He is on panel advising on value of oncology drugs with JCO.  Also involved with IASCLC on discussion/research of value in oncology.  He also spoke to payer conference (eg. Attendees such as Blue shield) about oncology treatments and value.
o	He mentioned he supports CA legislation that prevents insurance companies to limit provider choice in oncology treatments.
•	He brought up early results in 1L NSCLC nivo studies not that impressive.  Reactively mentioned Checkmate 012 study has shown ORR 23% in all comers (phase I trial).  He says in 1L, not impressive compared to platinum chemo response rates, that are as high as 40%.

•	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.

	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ""because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda"".  
	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.",1458878400.0
"Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

•	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
•	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
•	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
•	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
•	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
•	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo's SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo's less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
•	He expressed that Atezo's q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution's selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
•	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
•	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO's when comparing the Nivo group's maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.
•	His institution is wanting to narrow available PD1 agents in their pathways and will be sitting down to evaluate the 2L lung space as well.",1479445200.0
"Met with a national/regional lung AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
•	AI reactively mentioned that his institution is currently sending to 3rd party labs to conduct both the BMS and Merck PDL1 assays, due to inability of their in-house lab/pathology to support this testing in-house.  
•	AI expressed frustration that the one test they can perform in-house is the Ventana (Atezo) assay, for which they recently bought a machine.  We reviewed the FDA blueprint analysis that showed the Ventana assay as highly discordant with BMS/Merck assays and how this could lead to misclassification of some PDL1 expressers as non-expressers due to lack of sensitivity, which he admitted to understanding.",1480914000.0

"Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
•	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
•	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
•	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
•	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
•	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
•	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
•	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
•	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.
•	He mentioned that the NCCN NSCLC panel has been busy with recent updates with Pembro and consideration of Atezo data, with emails flying around the group.",1478754000.0
"Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
•	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
•	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
•	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn't believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
•	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
•	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.",1478754000.0
"Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
•	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
•	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
•	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
•	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
•	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
•	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.",1478754000.0

"The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI's/TL's in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
•	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
•	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
•	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
•	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
•	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
•	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
•	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
•	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
•	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
•	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC‐squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD‐L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD‐L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD‐L1 positive (>1%)
•	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ""chaotic state""
•	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
•	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it's positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
•	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
•	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
•	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn't elaborate more).
•	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can't show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
•	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
•	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
•	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
•	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
•	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
•	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they've seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
•	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
•	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
•	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ""one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.""",1458878400.0

They did say it was commendable that a broad patient population was studied and understood that the cuts by various levels of PDL-1 did not hold up due to study design.  We also clarified with them the rationale of using PFS vs OS due to cross over anticipation of the chemo group to the standard of care, and with that reinforced the 2nd line standard of care – Opdivo.  The only real question they had came when stating that our belief of 1st line therapy was to not only take off the brakes with a PDL-1 inhibitor, but to also step on the gas with a CTLA in combination, they asked if we were doing anything to temper the cost of the combination therapy.

Nevertheless they concluded that, worst case scenario, Opdivo is still as effective as chemo in this population but with a better safety profile. Therefore, Opdivo is clearly the best option for NSCLC patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression. In his opinion Opdivo is very well tolerated by patients, much better than chemo.

""Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing"". Easy decisions are made first – those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ""what would a reasonable person do?"" If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines… Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs – a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don't like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.

NCCN is working on a ""guideline"" for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche's 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it's attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial.",1470974400.0

He shared the following insights:

On PDL-1 expression, when discussing the indications and trial designs of the current 2 agents, he proactively stated that felt rather strongly that the way the trials were designed should guide how the agents are used.  In discussing potential first line use, he stated that as pembrolizumab is being studied in this setting in the greater than 50% staining population, then pembro really should be limited in it's use in that population.  He stated that if Nivo is studied in greater than 5% (or 1%), then Nivo should be used in that population.  He did not feel one agent should be used in a manner that was supported by another agents data

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ""market"" pembro as the drug of choice in the ""positive"" or ""high staining"" patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

Andy discussed various trial information.  We also discussed NSCLC screening, which he felt his hospital was not doing enough of.

HCP shared that the inclusion of nivolumab +/- ipilimumab for SCLC in NCCN is very positive for patients as no valuable options exist following 1L chemotherapy. HCP shared that he would likely start patients on nivo monotherapy and add in ipi if response is slow or patient shows progression.,1470801600.0
RTL expressed that he was surprised the data from 032 SCLC wouldn't be good enough to get an FDA approval on given the recent NCCN recognition/update and the overall lack of good treatment options in that form of lung cancer.,1471579200.0
"RTL states the most exciting data at ASCO was the -032 SCLC data as there has not been any progress in that disease for an extended period of time. Some concern was expressed about the patient population as many SCLC progress so quickly or have quickly declining performance status, hence time to progression on previous therapy and time to response will be a key component for this population.",1467259200.0
"RTL in lung and SCLC NCCN panelist shared that there was very little resistance within the panel around adding nivo+/-ipi as a 2A for 2L SCLC.  In addition to clear efficacy, he stated the fact that 032 showed that the toxicity profile was more blunted than the I3+N1 dose in melanoma and NSCLC was the 'final supporting straw'. 

He did state that they expect it to be ""some time"" before the discussion section would be updated to include nivo/ipi data.",1470974400.0
"Attended the California cancer consortium conference where a regional AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium about SCLC.
•	Reviewed CM 032 SCLC Nivo or Nivo/Ipi in SCLC
o	31% Nivo/Ipi; 12% Nivo
•	Response Looks promising, but still early
•	Combo more toxic looking at gr3/4 AE's, concern in patients with multiple co-morbities due to smoking.
•	SCLC appears to be good candidate for checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
•	SCLC Characterized by high mutational load
•	PD1/CTLA-4 inhibition is the most promising IO combo",1471320000.0
"Met with a regional oncology P&T AI for a major national payer, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
•	AI mentioned that he is interested in a BMS produced, unbranded deck/package, which is meant to convey the value of IO agents (such as Nivo) in producing durability and potential for on-going responses in responders. 
•	AI says such a deck/information, targeted towards non-medical or non-subject matter experts, would be very valuable to justify the value of IO agents due to durability of response, even if efficacy endpoints such as PFS are not much greater than control groups, if OS benefit is seen. 
•	AI questioned in Lung studies why there are no major trials studying Ipi alone against the backdrop of 032 where high percentages of the patients were PDL1 non-expressors.  Responded to AI that BMS commitment is to follow the science and is committed to trying different IO combinations in different tumors, due to the responses seen with IO combinations in melanoma.",1468209600.0
"The 1L PDL1 testing will be hectic.  it is likely that PDL1+ will go to Pembro, because 2L treatment with Nivo will not require PDL1 testing.",1462507200.0
1L NSCLC Opdivo + Chemo is a mistake.  Tails of OS curves will mimic 1L therapy and basically HCPs will be giving Chemo to patients that do not need it.,1462507200.0
"HCP at a major institution stated that all NSCLC patients are being tested for PDL1, and the ONC feels that this is being driven by the pathologists, since he doesn't see any purpose for testing for 2L tx.",1462507200.0
"In response to 057 data, HCP in attendance at NSCLC program asked, ""why not use Docetaxol since it is so much cheaper and shows the same efficacy?""  

This question was answered by another HCP in the audience who stated, ""there is no question Opdivo is easier on the patient, that should carry more weight in your decision vs. price.""",1462507200.0
A local TL stated that he has treated upwards of 50 NSCLC patients and hasn't seen an AE greater than 1.,1462507200.0
The cost of PDL1 testing is nothing compared to the monthly dose costs of the drugs.,1462507200.0
"Melanoma/Lung RTL had participated in pembro melanoma EAP and due to good experiences and preferred Q3w dosing, ""found no reason to try nivo in melanoma"" (ie during 1L or 2L monotherapy).   Once RTL started using nivo for lung (and is ademantly against PLD1 testing so won't use pembro for lung) has switched over almost completely to nivo in melanoma also.  ""If efficacy is the roughly the same, it just makes sense to stick with the one drug in a class that is most broadly usable.  I think pembro is a very good drug, but if I can only use it in half the patients I can use nivo, why bother?""",1459483200.0
"Regional IDN with owned oncology practices has communicated that they are using a mixed approach for dosing opdivo in RCC, mel and NSCLC.  In this case they are using 3mg/kg for patients below 80kg and 240mg for pts >80kg.  Also he shared that with vial overfill and +/-10% dose efficiency adjustments he projects his current opdivo usage program to save his system ~$200K per year.  As this IDN has been acquired by Kaiser, he shared that he communicated this as a ""best practice"" to a broader KP oncology subcommittee and it has been shared through the KP system.  He shared that his KP NoCal counterpart has communicated that by using this dosing method, KP NoCal has estimated a yearly savings of $5.3MM.",1481864400.0
"during the inservice in emory palliative care, one of the leading attendings discussed ongoing difficulties in management of musculo-skeletal pain induced by nivolimab in patients with ongoing multiple co-morbidities. Further explanation showed that palliative care is currently very limited in situations when patients who are on opioids with already compromised renal or liver functions and continue to benefit from IO therapy but now unable to cope with increasing muscle/bone pain. Very common for patients not to report pain to his/her oncologist in fear of discontinuation of therapy. Increasing opiods does not bring a desired pain relief and adding large doses of Tylenol or ibuprofen in the setting of other co-morbidities may not be an option for these patients. The most common outcome for patient  was discontinuation of opdivo therapy.
This attending also expressed a desire for a specific care manual with emphasis on challenging supportive care situations in the setting of immune therapies. She suggested possibly explore writing of the guidelines by a reputable palliative care experts from a large oncology center that fully incorporates palliative care services.",1461211200.0
