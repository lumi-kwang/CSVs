"Met with AVP over specialty pharmacy at regional IDN with > 40 hospitals.  He expressed frustration with the limited distribution network for Revlimid.  He was interested in exploring a study to assess time to treatment and any potential delays, outcomes, and costs with patients not being about to get therapy with Revlimid backbone including Empliciti.  He thought that there could be a way to improve the patient care experience by understanding how infused drug administration for MM coincides with potential oral chemotherapies and its impact on coordination of care of combining these two processes.  We discussed running feasibility on Empliciti and newer therapies specific to the newer therapies.",1474603200.0
RTL in the Boston area mentioned  that he is still following 6 patients from the original ipi post allo study. Mentioned that one MM patient was at PR for 1 year then transformed to CR. He is not sure what caused this transformation but possibly related to immune memory,1474862400.0
LTL mentioned that Elo is forgotten due to the recent Dara data publications. TL is using Dara in earlier lines of therapy and in salvage settings. She mentioned that they have figured out necessary premeds for Dara and infusion reactions are now not an issue. She has one patient on Elo in a clinical trial but otherwise has not used it. She mentioned Elo needs new data to come out otherwise the excitement of Elo is lost. She mentioned that she may have a non-aggressive relapse patient that she is possibly considering Elo.,1468296000.0

""Is it worth it to spend the extra money for regimen vs nivo for a small/no increase in PFS?"" They were keenly aware that the trial was not designed to compare Nivo to regimen statistically; however, they were comparing them numerically. After advising the payor to look beyond PFS (due to potential pseudo progression) and look at ORR/6% high for regimen/best chance at a respone with regimen, the payor agreed it makes sense to cover regimen for all patients.",1463198400.0

NTL said ""no"" to Empliciti and Daratumumab and suggested HCP to treat patient with Opdivo off-label. The off-label recommendation was based on the results from the study ""Preliminary Results of a Phase I Study of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies"" presented at ASH in December 2015. The patient received one-dose and is being closely monitored.",1468123200.0
"RCC RTL says his approach to 2nd-line RCC treatment is dependent on how patient responds to first-line anti-VEGF TKI therapy. He says that approximately 60% of patients have a ""good"" response, defined as PFS of 1 year. For those patients, he feels disease is driven by VEGF, and would thus prefer lenvatinib + everolimus in the 2nd-line. 

For patients who progress more rapidly (particularly those with rapid progression in less than 6 months), he feels Opdivo might be more appropriate in 2nd-line.

NTL presented at a local ONS symposium.  Reviewed the top 8 agents that are making a difference in MM treatment.  He included Elo stressing its use in early relapse with Len but said studies my show it will work with Pom as well. He also felt that IO was going to be a part of the future combinations with future 4 pillars with the inclusion of monoclonal AB including Dara/Elo,1476072000.0
Question in regards to use of Elotuzumab after Daratumumab.  RTL felt there was still opportunity to use Elotuzumab as long as patient still sensitive to Rev.  He stated that immune recovery after Dara would take about 30 days after last dose,1476072000.0
NTL of large practice and treats MM has many patients he has taken off the revlimid and continued the Elo/Dex.  He would like to present his data in the near future.  He has suggested a trial where patients start on elo/dex and if they progress be placed on ERD.,1476072000.0
RTL of large MM practice.  He does not place emphasis on MRD status in his treatment of patients.  He does not think it is always accurate and thinks the way it is being used does not measure true negativity based on variability of marrow and technique. He has treated patients for years that have disease but very low levels of m-protein but still having quality of life. He feels if we treat to MRD will lead to over-treatment and this could affect patients quality over quantity of life.,1476072000.0
"NTL presenting at dinner presentation asked who to deal with early relapse of disease.  He would use Elo first otherwise we won't be able to use it later, especially if Dara moved up to earlier lines.

NP from academic setting that sees many relapsed myeloma patients. Sequencing of drugs important especially since she is seeing more of the doctors going to Dara earlier.  She feels that Elo needs to be used earlier because it won't be able to be used after Dara.  She discussed the thought that there is a 6 month time period that would be necessary after Dara to use another agent like Elotuzumab,1474689600.0
Local TL looking at the demographics of patients on Eloquent 2 and those that had prior Len before getting ERD.  He felt we should be showing how those patients did on the slides,1474689600.0
Local TL reviewed slides and questioned the incidence of infections especially notable VZV.  He feels we should mention the addition of needed prophylaxis much like they do with ACV and the IMIDs.,1474689600.0
"NP and MM expert noted that many of the patients get infections and when she is caring for patients she encourages them to have proper immunizations like H.Flu, Pneumovax and VZA prophylaxis to prevent infections while they are getting treatment",1474689600.0
NP in academic setting will not give patients their dose of Elotuzumab if they have not taken on the day of the infusion even if it is 3 hour before.  She will send them home and have them return the next day for their infusion.,1474689600.0
Local TL feels that Elo should be used earlier in treatment and upfront as a triplet. Not familiar with the side effect profile and was under the impression there was more neutropenia with Elo in comb with RD and didn't want to use it on those patients that have seen multiple lines of treatment.,1472356800.0
NTL feels view of  Elo in the refractory and relapsed setting is poorly accepted due to results of the monotherapy trial.  He is currently treating patients on Elo/Dex and would like to write the results of those patients outcomes up in the future,1469419200.0
Met with research coordinator who would like to do more research as it relates to MM patients in the relapsed and refractory setting but it is difficult getting the trials because of the types of patients they usually see in their setting that are not easy to fit in with the eligibility criteria.,1469419200.0
NP of large community practice that see's many MM patients. She questioned why one would want to chose Elo over Dara given the Dara outcomes that were most recently presented at ASCO.  Many of her patients are already getting RD and it would be difficult to chose ERD.,1469419200.0
"RTL of large academic center, very interested in our pipeline and combination of agents especially the CXCR4 and Bromain domain inhibitors. She feels we still need to explore novel agents since we don't have the cure yet. She also thinks we don't have sequencing and rational combinations to follow and will need to look at trial endpoints of ORR, PFS and how to use MRD at it's applicability to assessing response and further treatment.",1469419200.0
TL from Kaiser that treats large number of MM patients and ultimately transplants said that Kaiser has not put Empliciti on their formulary because of its lack of monotherapy.  She mentioned that if they want to use it they can request but with the other opportunities to use other combinations like Daratumumab they use that over the ERD combination,1468468800.0
Local TL told of experience in treating elderly myeloma patient.  When patient achieved VGPR he stopped her treatment to give her a break from therapy as he feels patients need to be off therapy to help with QOL issues.  He monitors her every two weeks and said the last time he took her off treatment she had disease free interval of over 1 year.,1468468800.0

HCP wanted to put patient on ERD who would be considered aggressive relapse after patient had 3 prior therapies and questioned why he shouldn't consider ERD in this situation. Patient could not tolerate Daratumumab because of very bad infusion reaction,1466568000.0
TL that has very large population of myeloma patients does not use Elotuzumab since their center has done many of the Dara trials and are comfortable with its use and now participating in SAR/Pom trials.,1466568000.0
RTL had patient that progressed on ERD with questionable biclonal disease. No M-protein elevation noted but BM bx showed >60% PC's. Patient did not tolerate other monoclonal ab due to very bad allergic reaction.  Physician still wanted to give Elo and felt IMID best option but did not have clinical trial or approval to give Elo with another type of IMID. Would have like to see if we had any other trials with other IMIDs or combinations for refractory disease,1466568000.0
RTL voiced concern about seeing Dara being used in multiple combinations and not as how it should be sequenced. She feels it should be based on the approval and sequence the patient with the other combinations until we know the data.  She feels it is not easy to give especially in smaller clinics which need to give it over 2 days.,1462852800.0
"NP at Academic and manages MM at varying stages noted to push back when a physician wanted to put a patient on Dara and instead wanted to put the patient on ERD since patient as already been on IRD, VD and it had been over a year since that patient had Rev..Felt the patient was too ""beat up"" to tolerate the Dara and had the physician change to ERD instead of Dara",1462766400.0
NTL notes that he has taken a patient off Revlimid because of intolerance but patient continues to have SD on Elo/Dex.  This was a patient that has had multiple lines of therapy,1461988800.0
NTL would like to see trials with E/K/D vs E/P/D as well as frontline trials.  He is using 3-4 combinations with patients in which he is recycling the drugs used.  He is still seeing responses even if switching to same drug class but different drug,1461988800.0
"Large group practice tumor board asked if medical education in regards to Multiple Myeloma could be reviewed in addition to the slides for Empliciti since they don't see MM often and many of the members, some newer HCP's would benefit with a review of MM",1461988800.0
NTL at academic center that see MM for transplant would like to see Elo used earlier after transplant more in a maintenance role.  She did have a patient that was on the EAP trial that continued to have response even though the patient had been highly refractory. She felt because of the clonal evolution the drug could be recycled again.,1461988800.0
"NTL speaker discussed the variables to consider when sequencing the treatment options for MM. Depth of response and durability of response are key when deciding which tx to use. He mentioned the use of MRD and how patients who had better PFS were those patients that were MRD negative after their tx had better PFS and OS. But he also stressed the importance of looking at the toxicity, convenience to the patient, the patients disease state as other important considerations. He did say 3 agents are better than 2.",1459396800.0
"NTL at recent Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Blood Cancer Conference spoke on MM.  She reviewed the history of treatment, staging, diagnostics and prognostics.  She prefers the triplet therapy over doublets and reviewed both the KRD and VRD trials. Interestingly she mentioned that in the relapsed setting you can go back and use drugs again if greater than a year since the disease is changing in heterogeneity and the development of clones,  the disease may still respond to a drug that may have been thought to be resistant or refractory to before.",1458360000.0
LTL of large military based hospital that provides care to many MM in varying stages from upfront to RR.  He sees many of these agents as high cost and only contributing to the PFS at an increased cost without seeing true benefit.  He feels there will be a big dept incurred in treating these patients with high dollar drugs contributing to loss for many centers. He thinks it should be based on treating the patient as a whole and considering other variables when making treatment decisions.,1458100800.0
"LTL who sees about 30 MM pt yearly in both FL, RR and post ASCT prefers to use single agent if possible on patients and has yet to use Empliciti and not sure if she will in the near future.  She would more like to see it in the upfront setting and would prefer to use it in the maintenance setting",1458100800.0
Discussed the numerous choices for patients including transplant and he feels there is still a place for transplant in the patient care continuum. So he would use the monocolonal Abs more in the minimal residual disease state maintenance after auto SCT. He personally uses KRD triplet for high risk patients.,1457067600.0
"large volume practitioner that participates in many trials with different companies. Has been in > 3 trials with BMS. In speaking about his approach to MM, he prefers to use CyBorD if high tumor volume otherwise he uses VD or VRD,  Has big dislike for Revlimid especially in maintenance b.c he feels his patients get more peripheral neuropathy. Does not think transplant brings value to pt when so many option available and can bring pt to the same outcome with drugs. Feels Elo is easy to use, has had patient on it for 2-3 years. Would rather use it early in the treatment phase like upfront or in a maintenance setting.",1455339600.0
"Regional TL that has experience with 3 Elo trials.  Has strong beliefs in transplant role in survival. The evolution of myeloma changes as the disease and the patient get older.  He is seeing more patients with leptimeningeal, lymphoma type and CNS disease.  MRD is important and he has been sending all his samples for MRD.  Would like to see upfront trial results of Elotuzumab since he feels it is a narrow window of use in the RRMM patient.",1455339600.0
"TL sees 10-15 new patients/year, gets same amount of referrals and manages post transplant. Had difficulty seeing how ERD would fit with his current population profile. Would rather see it in the upfront setting and maintenance setting",1454648400.0
community doctor perception of NCCN presenters topic on MM and his feeling that the presenter was neutral on transplant and seemed to be moving away from that as an option but had stated there wasn't enough data to make a firm decision.  He felt she was not that positive towards transplant and stressed the decision needed to be based on the patients choice as primary.,1454648400.0
"TL notes he does not have any issues with insurance coverage on most of his regimens.  Does not seem concerned about the cost of combinations, especially if using multiple infusional medications.  If there is question from the insurance company they are able to get the drugs covered if they provide the necessary article and data that supports the use of the drug.",1478059200.0
"TL at large CC that treats large number of MM patients.  They currently have 15 MM trials and try to place their patients on trials as much as possible. He felt they had so many competing trials they would not see much use to have a trial with Elotuzumab, especially given its current indication. He would like to see if there was data on maintenance. They are participating in a CD38 Ab and PD1 inhibitor trial. They mostly see RR patients and referrals for transplant.",1478059200.0
RTL would like to see a trial using IO combinations without an IMID or PI. Patients that get IMID and PI are more intolerant and harder to put them on those agents and feels there is enough activity in PD-1 blockade and SlamF7 that would affect the disease possibly sparing patient of adverse effects,1462852800.0
"During an Empliciti PVP presentation to a national PBM, a director of trade relations mentioned that their organization is developing a medical management policy for MM.

"During an iplan with Nurse Practitioners at a major academic center that had previously conducted Empliciti studies it was uncovered that they were infusing all patients with Emplicit at a max of 2 ml/min, not realizing that after the 4th cycle they could increase to 5ml/min. When I reviewed the infusion rates they immediately all came to full attention and realized the chair time they could spare with the faster infusions. They have patients that have been treated for years now.",1457928000.0
"During a health plan meeting (which was the first we've had since the MM policy review occurred—in mid-June), a formulary manager shared that:
1)      he attended the MW CEPAC meeting (virtually)—and agreed with the panels conclusions,
2)      he also invited Patricia Synnott (https://icer-review.org/people/patricia-synnott-ma-ms/) to attend and speak during the presentation of clinical evidence at P&T (which she did).  This was so she could see first-hand how ICERs work was being incorporated into HP decision-making.  Patricia was part of the team that conducted the clinical evidence review portion of the MM ICER review. 
3)      Lastly, he and his team had a separate meeting with Josh Carlson (who conducted the cost effectiveness assessment), who presented and answered questions related to the CE analysis
 
At the end of the day, the decision was made not to manage the class, based on the complexity of the disease state and the lack of any clear differentiation with respect to the net health benefit vs Rd across the three regimens under review (something he agreed with the MW CEPAC panel on).",1470024000.0

TL mentioned her selection of agents in the frontline setting depends upon patient risk factors. If the patient presents with high risk disease she tends to use a K based regimen. If the patient has standard risk or comorbidities preventing the use of K she will start with a rev regimen. If the patient is eligible for transplant and achieves a CR after transplant she will go to maintenance therapy. If the patient does not achieve a CR after transplant then consolidation and maintenance.,1479618000.0

"TL mentioned that elo is a disappointing drug in its currently approved setting. She thinks its place will be in earlier lines of treatment/maintenance vs later lines. When she thinks of elo she thinks elderly, a maintenance drug or in the indolent biochemincal relapse setting as an add on drug but not in the HR population.",1479618000.0
My TL mentioned that quad therapy in the front line setting will become SOC. Starting a patient on a quad regimen and scaling back to a maintenance regimen can drive deep responses. She states that if a patient has a deep response the initial costs of quad therapy will be offset by preventing future hospitalizations due to disease complications,1478840400.0
My TL mentioned that we should look at combining Nivo with Ixa in RRMM patients as a phase 2 study. She mentioned that Millennium is interested in an ISR. She also mentioned Nivo+IRd in the FL/RR setting in hopes of getting deep responses leading to better long term outcomes,1478840400.0
My TL mentioned that elo should be added to any patient that is rev responsive. She mentioned that its a good drug but needs to fins its place in the community. She mentioned that adding K can be toxic in the elderly patient population so added elo to these patients is an option.,1478840400.0

"Regarding elo's use - my TL mentioned that its hard to find place for Elo since folks in 2nd and 3rd line are going to K-based combo and Dara in 3L+. He said we were probably excited we got approval for earlier lines over Dara but retrospectively, it almost makes it difficult where to place in the sequence of treatment options",1478581200.0
"My TL mentioned there is too much excitement about Dara that's ""out of control"". There is incredibly short F/U data in POLLUX and CASTOR and these patients ""they haven't even had a chance to progress yet"". He continues to state that Dara responses are not durable and said he sees it in all scenarios (weekly and monthly dosing). Also mentioned that he sees more plasmacytomas (extra-medullary relapses) occurring in Dara progressors. We didn't go deep in to MoA discussion but he is skeptical about the IO MoA of Dara",1478581200.0
"My TL mentioned that we should research single agent elo in the maintenance setting b/c of NK cell presentation which may lead to immune activation. Also, he mentioned that its surprising that we are not looking into nivo in the maintenance setting",1478581200.0

"During a recent meeting with my TL in the Boston area she mentioned that she uses dara and has patients who responded to it as single agent therapy. However, she does combine dara with other agents such as Pom if needed and sees dara as the next R-Chop regimen in the front line setting.",1478318400.0
During a recent meeting with my TL in the Boston area she mentioned that she would like to see more elo trials in the maintenance phase combining it with different agents and compared to rev. She mentioned that elo is niched and sees its uses in the maintenance setting or quad therapy.,1478318400.0
"While visiting one of my TLs in the Boston area, he stated that elo is niched into a patient population that is difficult to use. Also mentioned that elo's lack of single agent activity is a barrier for its use. However, when combining with E with Rd the results look good and 3 year OS is encouraging but has not used it in the commercial setting. He feels that combining elo with other agents will provide more clarity on its use since most patients are R exposed.",1478318400.0
"While visiting one of my TLs in the Boston area, he mentioned that he started a patients on dara recently and doing well. He has not had a bad experience with dara use thus far and typically uses it in combo. He believes once the patient is that far out in lines of therapy then combo treatment is the patient's best option vs monotherapy.",1478318400.0
Myeloma research nurse and Elo speaker in the Boston area mentioned that nurses are concerned because only nurses attend educational programs and no physicians.

Generally does not use transplant in his treatment regimen as he feels with all these newer agents he can push off transplant.,1477281600.0
"LTL mentioned that he thinks adding Elo into frontline treatment will increase response rates and TTNT. Additionally, he does not use Dara because of its long administration time. He can split the dose but this is an inconvenience for his patients as some of them travel long distances to be seen. Additionally, is concerned with the infusion reaction rate with Dara and for those reason has not used it yet.",1477281600.0
RTL mentioned that he sees Dara patients relapse once on extended dosing intervals. He mentioned this to Janssen and thinks every 2-3 week dosing is more appropriate. Janssen folks state that their PK models showed receptor saturation for 1 month so more frequent dosing should not happen.,1477281600.0
RTL mentioned that he has had good responses in tough patients (double refractory) using DCEP then Dara. Mentioned DCEP regains control and Dara puts out the fire in his relapsing patients.,1477281600.0
"RTL mentioned that he does not like IxRd - all oral regimen. Besides the fatigue and diarrhea his patients experience, he feels that compliance/adherence is another issue to be concerned about.

LTL in Boston mentioned that Ixa is a convenient but requires prior authorization whereas Elo does not. Also mentioned that he uses rev in maintenance and once patient begins to relapse he tends to use Pom or clinical trial. Does not think about Elo in this setting cause this is not our indication,1472616000.0
NTL in Boston mentioned that the new Dara data is dramatic if patients can get over the infusion reactions. She mentioned that is a patient has rip-roaring disease she will use Dara in this setting. SHe mentioned that Janssen's development is faster than BMS,1472616000.0

"Research nurse at large academic center in Boston mentioned that it's frustrating that in our protocol there is no verbiage to allow for less frequent vital sign monitoring after a ""x"" number of cycles. She mentioned that nurses complain that after ""so many cycles"" without an infusion reaction the monitoring of vital signs should be less frequent.",1472011200.0
Research nurse at a large academic center in Boston mentioned that their experiences with Elo has been positive. She mentioned it's been great to work with Elo cause of the ease of use and minimal side effect profile. She mentioned that one of the biggest complaints has been fatigue and the other is the dex schedule. She mentioned that often times patients forget to take the 28mg at home and come in without dex on board. Also dex interferes with phos levels so they recommend to patients to get lab work before taking their dex. She mentioned that in the community she would be surprised is physicians and patients follow our dex schedule.,1472011200.0
Local pharmacist at an academic center mentioned that they would not infuse Dara outpatient. Their concern is that it will tie up resources and potentially cause OT. Sees Elo being used early due to efficacy data and ease of use and Dara in later lines of therapy.,1471924800.0
NTL in Boston area mentioned that not all patients respond to Dara in the salvage setting. Those patients that don't have a response their disease is very aggressive. At this time there is an unmet need in this setting. NTL mentioned that he has used a check point inhibitor (off label) as there are no options left for these patients.,1471924800.0

RLT mentioned that once physicians become comfortable with sequencing therapies that are reluctant to change their practice patterns. He feels this is the reason why folks have not used Elo or Dara to great extents. Feels that the 3 year data for Elo looks good and hopes to use Elo as an option in his patients.,1468209600.0
RTL mentioned that he has several patients on a Kyprolis based regimen and to date no AEs reported. Goes on the say that he has not started anyone on Elo or Dara as of yet.

NTL from the Boston area recently presented during a patient advocacy group. During the talk he spoke highly and in some good detail of the CASTOR/POLLUX data and that dara is a game changer. He mentioned that we have never seem hazard ratios this low. He briefly mentioned elo and that it is well tolerated with minimal toxicities. He goes on to say - Who needs elo when we have dara - and closes this section of his presentation with at this time elo is for early use and dara for delayed use but more to come.,1467086400.0
NTL from the Boston are mentioned that he dropped Bleo years ago in ABVD. Feels that bleo does not add benefit with increased toxicities. Otherwise if bleo is given feels that most will give 2 cycle of bleo then drop.,1467086400.0
"LTL at academic center mentioned that combining Elo with Dara would be interesting. However, it would be interesting to see which drug would be the comparator in this type of trial. He hopes to see this combo in the future. Also states that as novel agents as being pushed into earlier lines of treatment and more pts being exposed to IO agents (Elo/Nivo) enrolling patients into trials that are IO naive will be challenging. Lastly, TL mentioned that CASTOR/POLLUX data looks good but there is more to come and this is just the beginning for IO in myeloma.",1466481600.0
Myeloma APRN at a large academic center in CT mentioned that patient on maintenance therapy who had a good response to frontline treatment will be re-challenged with their initial frontline treatment during a relapse. Otherwise patients will go onto a trial during relapse.,1466481600.0
"APRN at large CT academic center mentioned that physicians are discouraged with Elo due to no single agent activity. Additionally, she mentioned that Ixa use is challenging because of the Rd backbone. Lastly, They have a few patients on Dara mono therapy in the salvage setting.",1466481600.0
"RTL at a large academic center in CT mentioned that they can't wait to open the -602 trial. The myeloma team is very excited about this trial and have patients lines up for enrollment.

NP at a local community facility mentioned that her physicians are reluctant to change. They become comfortable with treatment regimens and tend to stay with them. SHe mentioned that they have a fairly large MM population and generally treat with a rev based regimen. She has seen some Kyprolis use and minimal Ixa. To date they have not used Dara or Elo at their practice.,1462939200.0
LTL mentioned that data from the Dara combo therapy is looking good. He mentioned that single agent activity is not a deal breaker and he sees Elo being utilized in the right patient. He mentioned that Elo will probably fit well into frontline quad therapy or maintenance setting. Primarily uses RVd in FL setting.,1462939200.0
LTL mentioned that large academic centers are treating HR consolidation patients with KRd. He mentioned that there is no data to support this but if NTL are using this regimen then others will catch on.,1462939200.0

RTL at a large academic center mentioned that HCP are having a hard time adding Elo to patients that relapse after rev maintenance. RTL mentioned increasing the rev dose and adding Elo makes sense but there is no data generated to show efficacy. RTL mentioned he likes Elo but is having a hard time initiating it based front line rev use being so high.,1462161600.0
RTL practicing at a large academic center mentioned that the CD16 publication data is interesting. He is trying to figure out if this data is practice informing for utilization of Elo. He is questioning wether patients should be tested for expression prior initiating Elo.,1462161600.0
"RTL at a large academic center mentioned that when comparing RID vs KRd, KRd is challenging due to vascular toxicity of about 20% all grades. In the RR setting these risks are more acceptable but in the NDMM population this is harder to swallow.",1462161600.0
RTL at a large academic center mentioned that the EVd data is good. He sees the value with adding Elo to this regimen. Feels that this trial shows efficacy and feels he will us this combination in his practice.,1462161600.0

The use of Dara in combination with other agents may increase toxicities which this is something we need to watch.,1461124800.0
RTL mentioned that conducting a study in the maintenance setting looking at time to next treatment is important for clinicians to understand. Additionally looking at the aggressiveness of relapse and to see if -mabs will have any impact on aggressive relapses.,1459828800.0
"RTL mentioned using RVd in the frontline setting. However, occasionally will start with either Rd or Vd to see if the patient responds to a doublet. Then he will either add the third agent if pts has no response or will continue with doublet if he sees a response. He also mentioned starting with Rd in frontline to see if his patient responds and if not then why would he use rev in maintenance.",1459828800.0
"NTL mentioned that dealing with IRR is nothing new for physicians. Physicians are used to dealing with IRR and dealing with Dara IRR should be no different. As far as Elo, NTL feels that the dex dosing is too high may be contributing to AEs. NTL feels that lowering dex dosing should be fine and hopes to see less toxicities.",1459310400.0
"NTL mentioned that Elo will be used in the maintenance setting or in the less aggressive frontline setting. As far as single agent activity, feels that Dara, Ixa and Car have advantages over Elo and physicians look at single agent activity when selecting therapy. Also, NTL has been combining Dara with oral MM agents and to date has not received any push back from payers.",1459310400.0
LTL mentioned that they use Dara at his practice and they have not experienced drastic IRR. Feels that physicians are used to IRR and should be able to manage potential reactions. -mabs are not a new therapy so there should be no concerns and feels that people are making a bigger deal out of it than what it really is.,1459137600.0
"LTL mentioned that there is no sense of urgency in using Elo at his practice. Mentioned that it will be used at some point and sees it being added to their formulary sometime second half of the year.

When discussing -mab response interference, calls out Elo and no mention of Dara.",1458360000.0
RTL mentioned that he uses CyBord for patient with free light chain myeloma. He mentioned having great results with this combination in these patients. He mentioned using elo in this patient population after frontline treatment.,1457499600.0
"LTL mentioned he previously treated most myeloma patients with CyBord in the frontline setting. However, he mentioned that since ASH he switched to RVd in the frontline setting. Additionally, if a patient has a relapse while on maintenance rev, he switches to Kyprolis vs. increasing rev dose.",1457067600.0
"RTL mentioned that he feels two -mabs are not needed in RRMM. At this time he prefers to use Dara due to having single agent activity. As for Elo, he is skeptical when an agent does not have single agent activity even though the PFS KM curve for Eloquent 2 shows a clear benefit for ERd vs Rd. Additionally, he was not too impressed with the 2 year PFS data in eloquent 2 or with the DOR story associated with -mabs.",1456981200.0
RTL mentioned that he has a few patients ready for dara. He is concerned using dara due to infusion related reactions and therefore will have to admit these patients for their first doses.

"RTL states elo's single agent activity is a dud. However, based on elo's safety profile making it SOC with combo therapy in the frontline setting should be our priority",1455253200.0
"RTL stated that dara is our direct competitor. Dara's disadvantage over elo is dara's clinic time, chair time and patient time.",1455253200.0
Ixa is convenient for patients as an all oral regimen. Beginning to write for it so not aware of any financial toxicities associated with this drug. Payers should look at chair infusion time costs vs oral drug regimen costs to determine cost benefit analysis.,1454994000.0
RVd or CBord in the frontline setting depending on patient clinical presentation such as renal impairment or concern about lymphopenia. Most patients go to transplant then to rev maintenance. Sees elo in this space as label indicates treatment till progression.,1454994000.0
Sees elotuzumab's use in the maintenance setting. Overall elo is well tolerated compared to dara as their infusions are harsh. Experience has been that dara's infusion is long in duration leaving patients unable to receive full dose of treatment.,1454994000.0

"Insight specific to a discussion with a confirmed AI for AIM in the MM space:

When asked his opinion as to why Elo was in the third line (instead of second or as an option in second), he stated that when only one option is available, KRd is a better option in the second line due to the deeper response (pushed back with I/O story of uncoupling depth and duration of response). When asked if Elo could be added as an option in 2L, he stated a pathway is meant to guide a single therapy. When asked why in 1L there are therapy options/choice, we showed the pathway.  We questioned if a physician could be financially de-incentived by choosing Elo in 2L when there is an appropriate pool of patients who would benefit (as discussed earlier in the conversation). He stated that a pathway is meant such that it's appropriate for 80% of patients. Team asked for Elo to be added as an option in 2L (like mSMART guidelines).
o	After reviewing the pathway, Thompson stated the pathway needs to be update. He stated he's never used PAD in front line. He proposed a different type of MM pathway that is specific to particular patient characteristics. 
o	He stated that the median number of doses in Eloquent 2 trial was 2 prior lines of therapy; therefore, it does make sense in 3L. He stated that BMS needs to do a study comparing KRd in 2L to ERd. When AI stated that there is no clear winner in 2L, we candidly asked if Elo could be added to pathway as an option since there is data to support 2L use when there is no clear winner in 2L",1462334400.0

"A nationally recognized multiple myeloma AI/TL, and NCCN panelist, shared the following insights:
•	The availability of existing, novel options for the treatment of MM has begun to change practice habits in oncology.
•	Big proponent of open access, and keeping the options available for practitioners and patients is beneficial.
•	CyBorD is generally his starting therapy, but sees it as diminishing in practice.
•	Started, 9-10 patients on daratumumab, which has led to changes in their approach to its utilization.  According to real world experience, 80-90% of these patients have experienced severe, debilitating AE's and have had to be placed inpatient.  First-time infusions are taking upwards of 12-13 hours.  The practice has instituted a mandatory inpatient infusion for all patients utilizing daratumumab.  Therefore, outside of larger institutions and hospitals, he doesn't see daratumumab as being a feasible option.  
•	Ixazomib will overtake bortezomib due to its weekly dosing.  Sees it as part of 3-4 drug regimens for MM.
•	Elotuzumab has been utilized with success.  Due to his typical starting therapy, ERd can be utilized as early as 2L.  Success and safety is of high value, and the lack of infusion reactions in elotuzumab bodes well for its usage in inpatient/outpatient settings.  Addtionally, sees ERd as potentially practice changing in 1L, as well as in combination with Pomalidomide.
•	An unsolicitied question regarding EVd, and if we had any data regarding this combination.  Was unaware of our submission to the NCCN regarding this combination.  Upon answering his questions utilizing the reactive deck, he definitely sees upcoming discussions regarding the benefits of this combination at the next NCCN meeting.  His opinion of EVd is that it would provide another option in treatment, particularly in those patients more refractory to previous therapies.  OS and PFS data were good, but not great, but AE profile comparable to ERd.",1460520000.0
"I met with an AI at an academic institution and he shared the following unsolicited insights:
•	Dara is more of a game changer due to its single agent activity, and it really fills a niche in the treatment landscape of multiple myeloma better than the other newer agents.  It single agent activity really makes it advantageous in later lines, saving other combinations if needed.  
•	Sees Elotuzumab's real benefit in 1L, where the majority of patients will receive Revlimid.  
•	EVd data is solid, but not great, and would love to see this data read out over a longer period of time.
•	One promising thing regarding Elotuzumab is its potential in PI/IMID combinations, synergistically working towards a functional cure.
•	The majority of ERd is being used in 3L, but with no real straightforward algorithm in treatment.  Treats based upon the patient, disease velocity, and previous treatments utilized.
•	Only used NRd once, with an inferior response, response was due to lack of adherence by the patient.
•	RTL is very biomarker savvy, this is a hobby in his free time:  BMS did a wonderful job in identifying SLAMF7, particular to myeloma cells, really reducing the emergence of immune mediated adverse events in the usage of Elotuzumab.",1460520000.0

Myeloma: presented data on ELOQUENT-2: overall impressions for Elotuzimab good in efficacy and SE profile. Daratumumab results exciting though noted cytopenias.  Stressed higher incidence of infusion reactins in Dara.
NSCLC: TL and NP presented Nivo data in 2L first, remarking on differences in squamous vs nonsquamous in regards to PD-L1 expression., though all pts showed response and  testing not necessary. Stressed pembro with same indication in 2L but approved for  PDL1+  pts only. Remarked how exciting it is that pembro approved in 1L for pts with PD-L1 > 50%, though failed to mention the percentage of lung cancer pts that high expression represented.

"Jai Puthenveettil and I recently met with an AI from an NCCN institution in the Northeast to discuss Elo and its place in the MM treatment landscape:
-This AI believes that the ideal Elo patient is one that isn't refractory to Revlimid.
-This AI has not used Elo since the clinical trials, but had a favorable impression of the drug. Expressed excitement in participating in the Elo-Nivo-Pomdex trial.
Categorization in MM:
-When the topic of assessing relapsed/ refractory patients to determine the next best treatment option, the AI had heard BMS' strategy of dividing patients in to Aggressive versus Non-Aggressive relapsers, and was generally in favor of the approach. 
-This AI stated that although treatments used in previous lines will always trump all management algorithms, the second most important factor is the severity of the relapse, (i.e., aggressive versus non-aggressive). Are patient's lab results starting to slowly head in the wrong direction or are kidneys failing?
-When mSMART Guidelines were mentioned, AI stated that ""frail"" is a common term/ concept that community HemeOncs can understand. This AI believes that both Mayo's mSMART Guidelines and a particular Italian study have facilitated adoption of the term ""frail"" in MM.
-This AI believes that with time the community will be most comfortable with ""Aggressive"" and ""Frail"" when categorizing patients because those are the terms most accessible in literature, etc.",1473134400.0

-This TL had been very impressed with the Dara data that was presented at ASCO. He thinks Dara is moving to first line and every other new drug should do the same.
-When asked about Elo, he said he liked the toxicity profile (or lack thereof) and thought that the only place where it's first choice is as an add-on for patients on Rev maintenance post-transplant. 
-He was intrigued by some of our future plans for Elo (e.g., ENPd).    
-He's unsure whether patients in the future would be able to tolerate a Dara combo in first line and KRd in second line (or vice versa), or whether those 2 regimens are so aggressive and potentially-toxic that they'd need something as an intermediate step in order to give patients a break to focus on a long, durable but tolerable response.

"Doug Bailey and I met with a multiple myeloma NTL and NCCN panelist from the Mid-Atlantic who volunteered the following unsolicited thoughts regarding Elo and the NCCN Evidence Blocks: 
 
Personal Experience with Elo:
o	Has used Elo in clinical practice, and results met expectations 
	Has experience using post-transplant: Rev maintenance-> Kd-> ERd
•	Likes the idea of patient taking a break from Rev before reintroducing it with Elo
	Believes in Elo's MoA and thinks its role can be maximized when combined with Rd in maintenance 
o	Panelist is a paid speaker for Dara, and thinks Dara can take over 1L, but acknowledges that Dara requires a big commitment from patients (because of infusion time), particularly at initiation 

NCCN Evidence Blocks:
o	The panelist did not see any value in the Evidence Blocks, and can't imagine anyone using them for clinical decision-making. 
	Potentially, can only see payers using them to create medical policy 
o	The panelist did not want to discuss specific discrepancies with Elo, such as Rd receiving 4 efficacy boxes and ERd receiving 3 efficacy boxes despite the results of the ELOQUENT-2 trial, however when it was mentioned, there was laughter and an admission that big errors such as that one needed to be corrected.
	The panelist did mention that the panel would be reconvening soon (would not disclose date) to attempt to correct glaring errors in the Evidence Blocks. The panelist referred to it as ""one last attempt.""
o	This panelist disclosed that definitions will need to be created for each number so that there can be consistency among responses, (e.g., 5 blocks represents Phase 3 data showing significant benefit over a SoC).",1468468800.0

-in an effort to improve their position when negotiating with payers, the practice is looking to design qualitative pathways beginning with the areas of lung, breast, prostate, and colon.
-a serious concern was physician pushback to pathways, and since this AI is tasked with quality and data management, a potential solution was discussed where past physician prescribing behavior could be captured and used to create pathways in order to minimize physician resistance. Referred to this as ""reverse pathway.""    
-in addition, other qualitative metrics will be put in place and are compiled from OCM, CMS, QOPI, COA, ASCO, among others.

His plan is to assess response every two months and escalate treatment based upon lack of PR.  This would include moving from doublet to triplet and triplet to quadruplet.  The quad therapy, in his eyes, should include EMPLICITI because it is most likely to have an effect here (RTL enrolled 6 pts on high risk MM EVRD SWOG trial and saw good results).

"RTL says that she has been in the process of starting up a trial with Ninlaro and pembrolizumab in second line transplant ineligible patients.  This trial would conflict with 209-602, which she is also starting up.  She said that she is thinking of halting conversations about the Ninlaro trial in favor of -602 because it is more intellectually interesting and because she is worried about the trial setup for Ninlaro trial.  The Ninlaro trial allows for patients to have had prior Velcade experience and she does not believe that these patients will respond to the Ninlaro.  She also admitted that this sort of trial setup is against the messaging of Millennium, that Ninlaro is the oral velcade.",1458878400.0
"RTL has prescribed darzalex to several patients in her practice and has not experienced any difficulty with having insurance companies reimburse split doses.

"LTL has prescribed elotuzumab to a salvage patient that has previously shown intolerance to revlimid.  The patient is very frail and lives alone, so she is worried that this patient will not be able to tolerate darzalex infusion.  She says that a significant reaction could put him into a nursing home, which he may not come out of.  In order to manage AEs carefully in this patient, the LTL is giving elotuzumab as a single agent at first- followed by Revlimid and dexamethasone once AEs are recognized as tolerable.",1458878400.0
RTL was presented the PI deck and his impression was good.  He is interested in the use of elotuzumab in maintenance.  Sees the combination with revlimid as a very tolerable option after transplant.,1458878400.0
"LTL believes that it will be very difficult to give elotuzumab to her patients because of the restrictive label.  She uses RVD frontline in most patients, sends off for transplant if eligible, and uses revlimid maintenance until progression.  She switches MOA after revlimid progression and would not consider increasing revlimid dose at this point.",1458878400.0
"LTL is very happy with the safety profile of elotuzumab and used it in a patient in the salvage setting.  The patient had already failed revlimid because of intolerance but, in this case, revlimid will be given at a lower dose.",1458878400.0
"RTL says that the PFS curve for Ninlaro shows that it is an active drug in myeloma and believes that it will be useful for his patients, however, he doesn't see that his office will prescribe a lot of this because they are not able to collect.  They prefer infusible agents.",1458878400.0
National academic TL was presenting poster data on isatuximab with Kyprolis in RR MM pts.  When asked if he saw a difference between Dara and isatuximab he offered that in 3 patients who relapsed with isa that he then put them on Dara with no response in any of them.  He stated that it's likely they both share cross resistance between them and likely no difference.,1480914000.0
National Academic TL offered unsolicited information that Dara is going to be the treatment of choice for RR MM patients with the PFS data that he feels continues to get stronger with time.  He stated Elo is good for those patients with a very slow relapse who are on Rev/dex but said the RR is still not as impressive as the Dara data.  He went on to say that ethically it is the better way to go to treat patients.,1480914000.0
National academic TL presented information to a hematology group surrounding the prevention of progression of multiple myeloma from early stages of MGUS and smoldering myeloma.   She commented that only patients with full blown MM can be offered therapy because enough isn't known about early stage disease.  Her lab is looking at over 600 samples of all blood cancers and integrating genomics in their assessment and are obtaining samples from other centers..   She stated that they are looking at smoldering myeloma samples and looking at sequencing and genomics including KRAS and NRAS and the potential of using targeted agents.    Treatment could be based on pathways.   She also said that the immune microenvironment plays a role and have seen that when mice have T-regs removed their myeloma is cured.   She is presenting data at ASH of Elo/Rd in high risk smoldering MM patients.,1479272400.0
"Academic TL offered that he doesn't like using Kyprolis in his patients particularly the elderly patients and the he uses Empliciti in these patients who are relapse/refractory.

He went on to say that he doesn't want patients to have these symptoms long-term.",1475294400.0
TL discussed the use of mSMART guidelines for initial treatment of MM patients with the use of Kyprolis for high risk patients.   He offered this is not standard of care at his institution and the data is not there and that insurance coverage may be an issue.,1475035200.0
Academic TL presented at a conference discussing the treatment of R/R myeloma.   When discussing Elo he stated that it almost got thrown out as it doesn't work as a single agent and that there is no benefit in absence of giving IMID with it.   He went on to say that even more promising data for MoABs were the CASTOR and POLLUX trials demonstrating very impressive ORR and PFS with daratumumab.  He went on to say it is leading to significant differences in patients.,1475035200.0
National TL discussed the use of dara vs Elo at a conference and stated that the data with dara from the CASTOR and POLLUX trials are a game changer for myeloma patients.  He stated that median PFS was not reached and said it may be out 4-5 years and the results were remarkable.  Commented that there was no difference in patients who had received prior len therapy.  He discussed the Elo data and said that it flattens out at 3 year.   Went on to say that it's hard to find a place for Elo with the carfilzomib and daratumumab data.  Stated carfilzomib has an established place and now Dara does too.,1474430400.0
Academic TL stated that daratumumab is a very exciting drug and is well tolerated.   He said that stable disease is good and that would accept SD as an endpoint if it prolongs the patient's life.   He went on to say that for more advance RRMM patients the gains have been modest with dara and innovative treatment strategies are needed.   He said immune based therapies have great potential in these patients.,1471320000.0
Academic TL in hematology stated that there are so many options for relapsed/refractory myeloma patients but feels that Elotuzumab is a good choice for those patients who relapse earlier in therapy.   He went on to say that PFS was significantly improved with Elo and this endpoint needs to be looked at in other trials.   He was uncertain that Elo would be covered by insurance later in therapy.,1471320000.0
Hematology academic TL stated that VRD is the best induction treatment for myeloma but that the neuropathy by this regimen is unacceptable.  He offered that he anticipates something will be replacing this in the very near future with all of the front line trials that are taking place.,1471320000.0
Academic hematology TL offered information that more trials are needed for patients with smoldering myeloma who have risk factors.    Some patients smolder for years without needing therapy.   He stated that once patients are put on treatment they never get off therapy.,1471320000.0
Regional academic TL in hematology stated that PFS was more important than focusing on CR for those patients post auto transplant. He said that a patient who maintains. PFS over a lengthy period of time is better off even with some residual disease.   He felt that MRD in myeloma needs to be better defined.,1469419200.0
Academic TL specializing in myeloma offered that she feels the depth of response is most important particularly those patients with aggressive disease.  She's not convinced that even those who are slow relapses won't progress to aggressive disease needing a quicker response when they do relapse.,1469419200.0
TL in large community practice offered that he and his colleagues are not using Empliciti for is R/R MM patients.    He likes the response seen in recent trials with daratumumab and feels that benefits the patient.  He also likes the ability to use single drug coverage for treatment.   In speaking about durability of response he felt that over time Empliciti may find a place but for now response is most important irregardless of the type of relapse a patient has with his disease.   He emphasized that daratumumab is the winner in his mind.,1468987200.0
TL discussed that the use of Elotuzumab in front line use is exciting as it could lead to patients not needing to have a transplant.  She is very excited to see the results of out Eloquent 1 trial.,1467950400.0
Academic hematology TL offered information that there is exciting  upcoming data utilizing daratumumab with a PI with 80% RR but the problem will be getting insurance to pay for an expensive combination.,1467000000.0
Community TL offered that he has utilized Empliciti and sees a value with it in patients who are slow relapsers particularly in view of it having low toxicity and the ease of administration of the drug.   He is impressed with the 3 year data.,1467000000.0
TL in an academic setting said there is discussion for a trial in myeloma patients utilizing auto transplant leading to lymphocyte depletion and then adding CAR-T cells afterwards to decrease toxicity.  He questioned whether the addition of CAR-T cells earlier in therapy may lead to be a substitute for auto transplant but being it is a standard of care for patients this likely wouldn't happen.,1467000000.0
In a fellow's conference discussing updates in therapy in multiple myeloma an academic TL stated that there are studies looking at SQ daratumumab instead of intravenous.   He stated that if it turns out to be positive for decreased toxicity it could lead to increased use of dara based on the recent study results with good RR and PFS.,1467000000.0
Community TL in large practice offered information that he was impressed with Dara PFS that was presented at ASCO and that experience with the infusion reactions is that can be managed and typically not an issue after the first dose.,1466136000.0
Myeloma TL in an academic setting offered that she rarely does anything if a patient's protein levels are slowly increasing but will wait until the 3rd to 4th visit before making a change.   She offered she would only add Elo to a patient who had not received Revlimid in the past due to no data for those patients who are currently getting Revlimid.,1466136000.0
Hematology TL in a large community practice offered that he continues to speak to his colleagues about increasing their utilization of Empliciti.   He said that in his experience it is a safe drug to be utilizing and that the synergy with it and Revlimid offers a good option for patients who are slow relapsers.,1466049600.0
TL in large community practice offered that he never uses 4mg as a starting dose for pomalidomide due to its hematologic toxicities.  Early on he saw so much cytopenia that he now uses 2-3mg depending on the age and status of the patient.,1462939200.0
Academic TL offered in a presentation that his site is doing a study with daratumumab utilizing the SQ route of administration rather than IV.,1458705600.0
Hematology TL at academic setting offered that Merck is doing a head-to-head trial of Pembro vs BV in the relapsed setting.   TL stated that this is a gutsy move on Merck's part as BV is such a good drug.,1457672400.0
TL offered information that she sees Empliciti being utilized in patients with earlier relapses after 1-2 lines of prior therapies.   She based this on the effects utilizing NK cells when they are more plentiful earlier on in the disease.,1456376400.0
TL in academic setting that she is using Revlimid as maintenance therapy post transplant until progression.   For patients with del17p she is using Revlimid along with Velcade,1456376400.0
TL in academic setting stated that she likes the depth of response with Kyprolis though she is not having much luck with insurance approvals for its use.   She further offered she utilizes KRd or KCyD for more aggressive relapses.,1456376400.0
Academic TL offered information on Ixazomib.  She feels it is no different to Velcade.  She participated in the study comparing Rd to IRd and saw no difference to velcade for results.  She further stated that it is a convenience to patients to have an oral agent but worried about the financial cost to them.   She was thinking that out of pocket costs are likely more for the oral agent than receiving an infusion of Kyprolis or dara.,1456376400.0
Academic TL offered information that daratumumab is more clearly efficacious as a single agent.  She participated in the Velcade/dex +/- dara trial.   She had 1 patient maintain response for 22 months with no complications.  She further stated that dara is NOT really an immuno-oncology drug and that there are differences in MOA compared to Empliciti.,1456376400.0
Academic TL stated that she would like to see a trial utilizing Empliciti post transplant for maintenance therapy.  She feels it would be important in view that NK cells are the first line of the immune system to return after transplant.,1456376400.0
Academic TL stated that dartumumab is a significant problem for the infusion suite as his practice.  His first patient who received it ended up being hospitalized due to toxicity.,1455080400.0
Academic TL stated he is worried about the cardiac toxicity with carfilzomib and has seen it in patients including a 55yo who ended up being hospitalized.  A BAL was done which showed drug toxicity.  He commented that he is surprised that no further studies have been done looking at this by doing BNP's and cardiac echos on patients as they are receiving therapy.  Despite the cardiac toxicity he feels that relapsed patients will agree to therapy with Kyprolis  as they do what they need to get a response in their myeloma.,1455080400.0
Academic TL offered that insurance is still an issue at his practice site and that insurer won't even pay for RVD despite being in the NCCN guidelines.   He is concerned that some of the newer therapies including Empliciti may not be covered even if they are in the guidelines.,1455080400.0
Academic TL offered that Empliciti would be a much better alternative over daratumumab for maintenance therapy post auto transplant due to that NK cells are the first line of the immune system to return post transplant.   She further stated they typically peak about 2 weeks after transplant takes place.,1455080400.0
"Academic TL, when asked about his treatment guidelines for relapsed/refractory patients, offered that his goal is to put every patient on a clinical trial.   His site is very much research focused.",1455080400.0
"Academic TL stated that ixazomib is not an important addition to the formulary and likely wouldn't utilize it.   He offered that it still causes neuropathy which ""he and patients hate""   He also commented that he did have one patient on the drug who is on Medicare and that he was able to get the drug for $5 with a copay card.",1455080400.0
Academic TL offered a trial concept that she is very interested in pursuing.  She feels that an alternating combination of Elo/Rev/dex given every other month with the other arm being an anti LAG3 or anti PD1 is a good concept.   She further stated that the Elo/Rev would prime the immune sytem to help the other arm of the trial.   Her idea would be this would be ongoing for 2 years.,1455080400.0
Academic TL was questioning the use of Velcade with Empliciti as she didn't understand how they would work together in view of Velcade's ability to decrease the immune system.   She offered that she utilizes Velcade for patients with both acute and chronic GVHD post transplant.  The combination makes no sense to her looking at the MOA.,1455080400.0
Academic TL stated that she will be very interested in the front line date of Empliciti for MM patients.    She's uncertain if this will impact patients going to transplant until she sees the data.   She further stated that more front line trials need to be done and is interested in participating in such trials.,1455080400.0
Large community based TL offered that he was excited about antibodies and that they could be game changers for front line therapy much like  R-CHOP for lymphoma.    He further stated that Car/Revdex is a better initial treatment for patients and that adding Empliciti may get a high number of patients into MRD and that they may not need transplant.    He further commented that this was a very exciting concept.,1455080400.0
Large community based TL offered a trial concept and thought it would be interesting to look at patients on lower doses of Revlimid (10-15mg) who become refractory and then to increase the dose to 25mg and add Empliciti at that time.,1455080400.0
Academic TL stated that his site is putting together pathways for multiple myeloma and that Empliciti will be 2nd line and beyond.   He offered that daratumumab is not 2nd or 3rd line therapy and will likely be on the guidelines for 4th line and beyond.,1455080400.0
Academic TL stated that she feels that daratumumab works better in combination with Revlimid than by itself.  She also offered that she's uncertain how safe it would be to give dara post transplant especially in view of the risk of infections with dara.,1455080400.0
Met with NCCN MM Panelist during ASCO post Amgen Adboard.  Noted Amgen very worried about dara data just presented.

"RTL is really interested in Elo trials for amyloidosis patients. 
Most amyloidosis patients can't tolerate standard Rev dose of 25 mg, but just a 10-15 mg daily. He believes amyloidosis is underdiagnosed, is found only when you look for it.  MM patients often have undiagnosed amyloidosis.  Clinical prognosis can completely change if amyloidosis is in fact underlying condition.",1466568000.0
"RTL typically treats with VRd and when patient is starting to show no response to V he switches to ERd.  Reb 2.5 mg is the least he uses and feels comfortable re-challenging with Rev.

"- Community TL and Empliciti speaker communicated he's heard other MDs discussion about choosing 1L therapy is more challenging now that Empliciti is approved.  Some of the comments include that Rd upfront may hinder the possibility of using Empliciti down the line. We discussed data from Eloquent-2 was particularly the % of patients that had previously received lenalidomide.  TL favors empliciti. This TL was trained at Mayo and mentioned a Mayo trial coming up combining Elo, Dara, PI, and IMID in MM.

"o	Considers Elo mostly for early relapse nor for aggressive disease. He mentioned he will consider Elo for an incipient lower relapse patient who doesn't need a PI, only Rd type of patient. So far, he has 2 patients on Elo.
o	He also tries a more personalized approach for 1st relapse depending on molecular subgroup, bulky disease, prior treatment, for example. He continued discussing a fairly standard way to treat upfront patients at this institution. If patient is low risk, will get 2 BMT with a dose-reduced consolidation. Most patients stay on VRd for 3 years. If patient is high risk, it means a decreased cumulative effect of drug dose than a low risk patient. These type of patients will receive K induction, hyb BMT and Carb/dex. This approach prevents tumor regrowth, in his experience. Also for high risk patients, he uses Malphalan over 4 days with Kd regimen.  Then one consolidation with K followed by KRd maintenance for 3 years. He finds K useful for molecular subgroups.  He has his way of sequencing drugs, but didn't abound on this. 
o	NTL also mentioned lack of an strategic approach at the community, which he think impact treatment approach at this level, not every patient goes to big institutions.

"RTL prefers to use dara before Elo in R/R MM. RTL completely understands MOA and Elo data set but duration and depth are not ""similiars"" Deeper is better as a marker when speaking to depth and duration.   Does not feel curves are holding up and results of elo are disappointing.",1469160000.0
LTL with respect to Ninlaro likes IRd with respect to QOL (noted convenient dosing and fewer side effects). We spoke about Tourmaline study. All oral regimens allows for better life integration.  We did note that PO regimens can result in higher out of cost which can result in more worries with less money left for other things which could cause the QOL to decrease.,1468123200.0
"RTL who is a speaker for Ninlaro, RTL was not aware of the CHMP (committee for human medicinal products within in the EMA) regarding the negative recommendation for Ninlaro in Europe.  When he speaks for company the message is on convenient first and foremost and fewer side effects vs. velcade and other infusible agents.",1468123200.0
NTL committed that it is too much for community oncology docs to be experts in everything.  All multiple myeloma should be treatment coordinated with or by specialized myeloma centers/docs.,1468123200.0
"RTL Not overly excited about the Elo Eloquent 1 data. Trial design weak doublet vs. triplet therapy it ""Better be a BIG win"" as trial design is for a weak frail patient. Did state the community is still using doublets so maybe your only chance for usage.",1467000000.0
"LTL committed that if Elo main does not read out soon it won't matter because Dara will be 1st relapse and eventually front line and with no solid data when NK recover- not sure where elo will fit in other then maybe main.  Did mention that he does not feel Dara is a 100% home run as majority public perction-post asco, he does feel it is a game changer but not the same as how Rituxan changed lymphoma.",1467000000.0
"LTL wanted to use Elo in a slow biochemical relapsing patient. Pt was also being followed by MD Anderson docs. Pt wanted to get MD Anderson's thoughts/blessing prior to LTL initiating therapy.  MD Anderson said to ""increase the rev and add dex."" LTL pushed back and asked why they didn't want to add elo and MD Anderson doc said we haven't seen a lot of utility/responses with elo. LTL insisted and pt has done well on elo (LTL couldn't remember if pt had a VGPR or CR).",1467000000.0
RTL does not think combining checkpt inhibitors with elo will change the face of how we treat MM.  Does not like the 602 trial design with pom/dex being one of the arms (regardless of crossover).  Check point inhibitor data to date is only semi-intriguing.  The data is intriguing but not anything to cause major excitement about. Did note that both Dara studies (Castor and Pollux) need longer follow-up.,1467000000.0
LTL uses elo at the first sign of relapse when patients are on rev or velcade.  Prefers elo over Ninlaro.  He has patients that travel 2 plus hours but believes in Elo's data and is amazed how many people are not aware of the Ninlaro data set.  LTL does allow reps in office.   LTL stated the reps only speak to the convenient dosing they shy away from the Ninlaro data when it comes to efficacy.  He has used Ninlaro in one patient only bc the patient does refuse to travel.,1467000000.0
"RTL stated it is up to elo/bms to figure the effects of dara on NK cells, ie when they recover.  Because dara will be eventually be frontline and ""obviously"" 1st relapse after the ASCO and EHA data. For Elo to have any hope BMS needs to figure out mechanism of NK cells with respect to Dara of when they recover.",1466136000.0
"RTL was speaking to a member of the sales organization, he thinks it is a mistake to niche Elo into a biochemical relapse.  Especially when there is not real data to support the message. He did note the response with high risk cytogenetics (which he liked the data)  He didn't like the comment to add Elo at the first sign of relapse which may not technically be the same as progression with out noting the change in m-protein. Was somewhat disappointed in the sales message.",1466136000.0
"LTL stated that BMS has been superb across medical and commercial organizations.  He stated that the BMS Elo group had educated  the outpatient and inpatient oncology clinics, everyone had been covered;  billing, nursing, pharmacy, and physicians.  He stated an example with the Dara launch the education piece was not as positive.  He had a patient that required a blood infusion and the patient had to go across the street to receive blood.  Jansen had not been there to inservice the oncology floor about the type and cross match with Dara and there was a near error.",1462507200.0
LTL that has both research and commercial experience with Elo.  He thinks that Elo is the easiest to give of all the new agents on the market.  Both him and his nursing staff have had positive experiences.,1462507200.0
"LTL that works in a large community practice, he (usually) utilizes Ninlaro over Elo when patients have to travel longer then 1.5 hours one way or if the patient prefers an all oral regimen.  He commented about both Kaplan Meyer curves.  He even stated that Elo's data is probably a ""tad"" better with longer follow up and liked the IO look of the Kaplan Meyer curve as he treats a lot of solid tumors.  When patients have to travel a far distance he will sit down with them and discuss the side effects, pros and cons of each, and let the patient assist in their treatment plan.",1462507200.0
Would like to know more about the MOA with Empliciti with respect to lymphophenia,1461988800.0
would be beneficial to have clinical trial with Elo in biochemical relapsing patients with various doses of len to see what is most effective or if there is a difference.  the eloquent 2 dose of len is not relative to most practices,1461297600.0
"RTL that is a transplanter, he sends patients back to the community doctors after transplant for convenience of the patients, he noted the importance of understanding the sequencing of these new meds to get the most utility of these newer and older agents. If distance is a factor, then they will opt for a 3 drug regimen that is all oral in the 1st/2nd line of therapy (with respect to Nilaro usage).  Many things factor into treatment decisions other then data from these new agents, such as insurance, how frail the patient is/performance status, and how far patients have to travel",1461297600.0
"RTL says that the PFS curve for Ninlaro is not ""overly impressive"" but does believes that it will be useful for his patients.  He doesn't feel that his office will use it a lot unless Pts push for it.  The number one and two  questions he gets from patients when it comes to treatments:  #1 how long does tx take/side effects  and how long will I be here from start to finish (and how long do I have to take it for).  Which will drive the use for ixa",1459224000.0
LTL that owns his own practice.  Dr. hesitant to use Elo or Nivo in practice with temporary J codes due to being burned by Merck/Pembro (reim took over half a year).  I educated him on our resources and used an example of another physician I work with that owns his own practice and explained his success with BMS products who has no trouble to date.,1459224000.0
"Pharmacist at an academic institution, very disappointed in the reconstitution directions for Elo.  They are using the drug at this site but the reconstitution and infusion directions are ""behind the times"" no reason NOT to have a concentration range in PI.  The Infusion table for RNs is confusing room, many RNs come to the Pharmacist to help convert as nurses don't Infuse at ml/min.",1459224000.0
RTL very excited to use Dara with an IMID.  Has not used the combo to date but has heard of other physicians using it and getting it paid for so going to use an Imid/Dara in next pt,1459224000.0
"LTL he brought up ASPIRE data, the holes he pointed out where ASPIRE pts were the lowest risk population, ASPIRE pts has treatment fatigue, commented if the curve holds ups in the next 6-12 months.",1459224000.0
"LTL with many patients already been exposed to Len or docs not willing to use len 2nd line (when maybe not refractory to len), company needs to generate data for Elo use either upfront or for patients that are truly refractory to Len. He was aware of other elo studies but with the landscape so quicky changing was more impressed with Kyprolis data and was not concerned about cardiotoxicity.  Will use kyprolis 2nd line when needed not elo. Would prefer to watch and wait at first sign of biochemical relapse instead of adding elo or switching therapy.",1457067600.0
"LTL uses CyBorD upfront, the KD, then will use Elo 3rd line.",1457067600.0
"LTL using Elo, Pom Dex instead of ERd.",1457067600.0
LTL follows guidance of RTL in the area where tandems are performed for MM.  With pts on Imids for 2 years (thal then Len) no use for Elo in his practice until there is front line data.,1457067600.0
"LTL stated that myeloma is very confusing.  The NCCN guidelines are not very helpful in regards to how to sequence all of these new agents for MM. Reaches out to NTL close to here practice for guidance not only does MM have new agents, when you are treating many different tumor types very hard to know what agent to use next in MM when she asks different docs and gets different answers.",1456290000.0
"Pharm D spoke with me regarding the electronic build of the eMAR, for patients that weight less then 50kg The 5ml/kg maximum volume requirement is very difficult to build in the eMAR system.  ""It is an accident awaiting to happen, would make a lot more sense to have a concentration range in the PI.""",1456290000.0
"RTL most patients when he gets them back form the community have progressed and are generally refractory to Rev therefore dosing Elo is difficult.  However when asked by community docs his thoughts on Elo, dr is a supporter and recommends adding it on ASAP in immuno-competent pts. He also treats a lot of VA patients feels elo is an excellent option for VA patients.",1456290000.0
"Has had no problems with Dara infusions, also has used Dara with pom.  Quoted that Dara single agents or Dara with Pom is much more to be ""excited about"" for his patients.  He stated that elo is EASY to give but really believes that depth of response is more important then durability of the response.",1456290000.0
"thinks Elo is a great new MM agent especially for the elderly he has 2 patients on Elo and both are tolerating it well.  Has used Nilaro for a pt. that lives > then an1  hr away.  Patients are similar in disease, ""Not that you compare two different patients and the two different drugs but is excited to see how they both do on the respective agents.""  Seemed more impressed with Elo data vs. Nilaro but does like the ease and convenience for patients (stated multiple times)",1456290000.0
"RTL considers Elo much safer then Kypolis, even though the cardio toxicity is rare it is real.  Would prefer to use Elo over Kyprolis in the elderly and biochemical relapsing patients. Did state that as long as you see are looking for the signs of cardiotoxicity it can be managed.",1456290000.0
"NTL, has lots of Elo experience (both commercial and clinical trial) disappointed in 3 year data with the response rates and the ""curves seem to be coming together""",1456290000.0
"RTL performs tandem transplants at his institution.  He utilizes, DPACE, thalidomide, and Rev over the course of his tandem transplant.  Does not see where elo will fit into his patients until we have front line data or main data.  Most of his patients when they relapse (he quoted not many do for years, his responses are greater then 10 plus years for relapses).

RTL would like to more clinical trials/data where elo is used triplet therapy vs a triplet therapy.  Most everyone agree triplets are better then doublets then design more trials where it is triplet vs. triplet with respect to elo,1454475600.0

"RTL declined 602 trial, RTL commented BMS is behind Merck (and every other Heme company with respect to research).  RTL already has the Merck PD1 trial in MM.  BMS trial design in not intriguing enough even with elo/nivo arm.  Did note pom/dex as a control is not up to par regardless of cross over.",1468641600.0
RTL was initially very excited with Eloquent 2 and 009 trials(her training was at MD Anderson and focused on NK cells) but then was disappointed with results of both trials.  Already has the Merck trial open with a PD1 inhibitor at institution in MM. RTL stated we need to better understand the effects of PD1 on NK cells in addition to the effects of Elo (with respect to mobilization of myeloma stem cells due to the CS1 mechanism of action.

"During a meeting with a national Multiple Myeloma AI and NCCN panelist, the following unsolicited insights were shared.

•	In regards to NCCN guidelines discussion on EVd data, AI said ""It will reflect on the new guidelines""(did not seem to know it was out).  In regards to EVd data, she said she doesn't understand/questions how biologically/mechanistically the combining of Elo and Bortezomib makes sense, from an immunologic standpoint. She stated that because of the immunosuppressive effects of Vel and the fact that she uses it for GVHD. She was unsure if the combination effect of elo plus bort. is in fact synergistic of just additive. She thought EVd was lacking good immunological trials to support it.  She suggested that it would be interesting to look at a trial where Vel is given then elo or elo/rev later to evaluate sequencing.  When asked about the concept of combining Rev with Vel (b/c Rev in immunomodulatory), she stated that Rev has killing effect more than just immune.
•	AI is a transplanter, adult, MM & Lymphoma
•	Most pts are referrals and therefore treatment is based on medical history but uses: VRd and CyBorD (MC until now), RVd has better data but insurance is a challenge
•	She noted that patients have a different immune system post-SCT, and questions using mAbs late due to immune system depletion.  Mentioned that NK cells are the first to come back post-SCT and that patients post-SCT are much more immunocompetent than we give them credit for
•	AI has one patient on Elo or will be soon (post auto-SCT, post carfilzomib)
•	Discussed data, infusion, AE, Efficacy and MOA(NK cell effect)
•	Interested on data for IO=Chemo vs Chemo+IO (sequencing)

Others:
•	Very interested to find out data on Chemo then I-O (i.e. PD1) or I-O then chemo (sequencing)
•	When asked about NCCN guidelines discussion around the EVd data, her initial response was that ""it will be reflected in the new guidelines"" (didn't seem to realize that the latest update had been published already)
•	When asked about her personal feelings on the EVd data, she said she doesn't understand/questions how biologically/mechanistically the combining of Elo and Bortezomib makes sense, from an immunologic standpoint. She stated that because of the immunosuppressive effects of Vel and the fact that she uses it for GVHD.

"1.	Met with a NCCN panelist in Multiple Myeloma, who shared the following unsolicited insights: 
a.	Shared Eloquent 2 PFS data, emphasized HR as telling with IO drugs, not just PFS
b.	She asked question about 009 data.  Shared EVD reactive deck with her.  She declined to share NCCN panel discussion around EVD specifically, but she said she agrees there's benefit with EVD, but that the PFS advantage of almost 3m does not wow her.  She said it's a potential alternative option for people who might not be responsive to Imid.  
c.	She reactively shared that for ERD, she feels that it's a better treatment for patients who have less lines of therapy, compared to Dara, because dara study is approved for 3rd line and high percentage of patients refractory to Imid/Lenalidomide (95% per Dara PI) so it's more likely to work in patients who are in later lines of therapy, compared to Elo which does not have Len refractory patients (even though 6% previously treated with Len, not refractory).  
d.	She says there is formulary at her institution and she submitted request for it to be added prior, but no decision yet from P&T.  It was supposed to be reviewed in 3/16, but now likely review in 5/16.
e.	She shared her thoughts that EVD regimen mechanism of action is likely more additive than synergistic, because you would expect to see more of a response in EVD if truly synergistic, and we don't see that type of response with EVD.

4.	She asked if there was phase I or II trial prior to Eloquent 2.  Reactively discussed study 1703 results with favorable PFS/ORR results higher than Eloquent 2, with a different patient population, but produced favorable efficacy results in line with Eloquent 2, to help strengthen her belief in the data.",1458878400.0

3.	AI states that institution is planning on instituting pathways, and is considering purchasing a system from the major available options.  She estimates that they may have something in place by 2018.  She didn't name a specific treatment area.
4.	She disclosed her institution has formed regional committees that discuss and review physician compliance and support of medication use initiatives, including selection of oncology treatments.
5.	She questioned the value of using multiple myeloma agents such as Elotuzumab in later lines, like 3rd line, given the immense cost of treatment for a patient without good long term prospects for survival.

•	They are aware of the great concordance between Merck and BMS assays, and are considering just ordering the Merck assay for patients on both Nivo and Pembro due to the concordance shown by the FDA blueprint analysis.
•	One of the AI's also mentioned that the Yale analysis on concordance between PDL1 assays was also convincing of their consideration above, which also came to the same conclusion of great concordance between Merck and BMS assays, but great disparity of these two with the Ventana assay.  
o	Reviewed conclusions of FDA blueprint analysis to confirm their understanding.
•	AI expressed recognition of Empliciti's positioning in MM as the medication with great potential for duration of response, with 3y PFS/OS after reviewing 3y updates with him.

•	She also spoke about Elo and gave her thoughts about her experience using it and its place in therapy
o	She uses ERD and has seen durable responses for patients who have had several prior regimens.
o	Her 1L is VRD or CyBorD usually.  She often uses triplet regimens in the front line.
o	She uses ERD in 2L plus even if they've seen Rev prior, because she says if they relapse on Rev containing regimen first line, they are not necessarily refractory to Rev, they are refractory to that triplet regimen as a whole.  She states that you don't know if the patient is refractory to Rev in that prior regimen or another component of the regimen.  
o	She subscribes to clonal evolution argument and heterogeneity of disease in MM population that patient may respond to Rev containing regimen even if they've seen Rev in the front line or prior lines. 
•	She also treats CML
o	She prefers Sprycel as 2nd gen TKI over Tasigna due to the side effect profile, including Tasigna's risk of cardiovascular side effects.  
o	She prefers Sprycel over Tasigna because Tasigna has a lot more issues with CNS toxicity that she's seen.
o	She prefers 2nd generation TKI's over Gleevac due to superior response profile.
o	She likes to start patients on Sprycel for newly diagnosed instead of Gleevac, although she states there is place in therapy for Gleevac.",1461297600.0
