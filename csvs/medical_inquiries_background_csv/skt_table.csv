I have a question about nivolumab and I was hoping you might be able to help me clarify some things with the providers. Nivolumab was recently approved in our HNSCC patients using weight-based dosing at 3mg/kg. Prior to this, we changed all of our HNSCC patients to flat dosing 240mg based on the NSCLC studies. Do you know if BMS is planning on reviewing flat-dosing for the HNSCC population anytime soon?

Linda advised that the physician is calling because she would like to see about enrolling a patient in a clinical trial for nivolumab. Thanked Linda and confirmed I will be calling the MD back momentarily. Returned MD's call (@ 1123). Dr. Patel reconfirmed her demographics/question. She advised that she is calling regarding a 47 year-old female patient who has liver mets due to stage 4 endometrial clear-cell cancer. They have removed as many of the liver mets as possible, but they couldn't get all of them out. She knows that Opdivo is generally approved for RCC and NSCLC lung cancer, but since standard treatment would likely not work in this patient (only has a 20% survival rate) she is wondering if a PD-1 (Opdivo) may be an option since this cancer acts similarly in vitro to RCC. She explained that this patient has extensive disease and this may be her last hope. Spoke from the Nivolumab-The use of nivolumab to treat patients with endometrial cancer SRL (even though it was more general in nature). Dr. Patel explained that this type of cancer is very rare and there is usually only 1 reported case each year. As a result, Pubmed searches/etc. aren't very helpful in this type of situation (due to the limited number of cases). She would like to know if there is a way for them to get approval for a ""1 person clinical trial"" with BMS for Opdivo in this patient.

Pharmacist is calling on behalf of his mother, who is considering starting Opdivo therapy. His mother has ""squamous cell carcinoma in her pelvis"" and has been on ""cisplatin and radiation in the past, but they were not effective."" Hence, why they are considering starting Opdivo. He knows that it is ""not indicated for use in squamous cell carcinoma of the pelvis"" and that ""the insurance probably won't pay for it,"" but he is willing to pay out of pocket if we have any data available to support off-label use in this type of patient. Placed caller on hold to do further research. No info found via the PI/SRLs. Informed caller of these findings and offered to take his request offline for further research. Caller confirmed this would be helpful and he would like to be contacted for follow-up via phone. Caller stated that he knows Opdivo ""is indicated for squamous cell carcinoma in the lungs."" Do you have to test the tumor before administering Opdivo to see if certain genetic markers are or are not present, or is this indicated for ALL NSCLC (regardless of these markers)? Advised caller that I will also look into this for him to avoid placing him on hold once more. Caller was appreciative. Explained our normal 2 day turnaround time frame to him, but offered to mark it as time-sensitive (since a patient is involved). Caller confirmed this would be helpful. Caller stated that his mom is 83 years old, she had ""pain in her hip"" and was diagnosed with ""metastatic squamous cell carcinoma."" At that time, she was given ""1-2 years to survive"" and it's already been ""about 1 year now."" She also had the Cyberknife procedure, which did not work. Her doctors have advised that there aren't really any other options to try at this point. But, the pharmacist saw our commercial and wanted to see if Opdivo may be an option (even if it's off-label). Advised caller that we will look into his request and get back to him shortly. Caller had no further questions at this time. Decided to file as AE-Y and PQC-Y for cisplatin (to be conservative).

Do you have to test the tumor before administering Opdivo to see if certain genetic markers are or are not present, or is this indicated for ALL NSCLC (regardless of these markers)? Advised caller that I will also look into this for him to avoid placing him on hold once more. Caller was appreciative. Explained our normal 2 day turnaround time frame to him, but offered to mark it as time-sensitive (since a patient is involved). Caller confirmed this would be helpful.

CS 08Dec2016 Search of ct.gov (Dec2016) using nivolumab and squamous cell carcinoma of the pelvis did not reveal any ongoing trials. CS 08Dec2016 Agree with no data letter with published lit search. Added EMBASE to lit search and added ct.gov search. Reassigning to JJ for fulfillment. CS 08Dec2016 1st attempt to provide verbal FLMT; left VM with 1-800-321-1335 number and provided Intx # to reference. JJ 08Dec2016 2nd attempt to provide verbal FLMT; left VM with 1-800-321-1335 number and provided Intx # to reference. JJ 12Dec2016 Close out if no response from HCP by EOB on 14Dec2016. No response from HCP. Kept documents attached to the case (to save time in case he calls back). Manually closing this request. JJ 15Dec2016 Lync message from Shelly while I was on break (20Dec2016): ""I have Brad, pharmacist calling you back. Case is 00485186. He said he can be reached for the next 5 hours pretty easily at phone 423-309-0596."" My response (20Dec2016): ""Hi Shelly. Thanks for letting me know. I had already closed out his request, since he never responded. And I have another PQC/AE/FLMT to complete before I leave at 5pm. It will probably be tomorrow before I get a chance to call him back. Thanks!"" Reopened requests. Will follow-up with HCP later this morning. JJ 21Dec2016 Called and spoke with Mr. Brad Standefer (provided OCRD). - Spoke from no-info response to address his first request (485089). Caller mentioned that the oncologist had said ""Opdivo is not indicated for squamous cell in the pelvis."" He told the oncologist that ""it's not going to be indicated for all different locations in the body because it can't feasibly be tested in all parts of the body, but it is a similar type of cancer."" He'd like to ""give his mom an extra 8-9 months if possible"" and will discuss with oncologist. - Spoke from the verbal PTC-Biomarker FAQ document to address his second request regarding testing (485186). Discussed PD-L1 and two other mutations CS listed in chatter message. Caller went on to state ""my mother's oncologist said that her tumor did not test that it would be sensitive to Opdivo."" Is this possible? Is there a test that would automatically rule out Opdivo? Suggesed caller may want to follow-up with the oncologist to clarify which specific test he performed, as we have no way of confirming/denying without this information. Caller confirmed he will discuss further with oncologist. He also asked if we have any information on how patients with positive PD-L1 status did with Opdivo. Confirmed that we have 2 SRLs (Nivolumab-Efficacy of nivolumab by PD-L1 expression in patients with head and neck AND Nivolumab-Nivolumab PD-L1 predictive biomarker in patients with NSCLC). I know he had originally asked about NSCLC, but the head and neck indication may be a more accurate match to his mother's type of cancer. Caller confirmed he would like to receive both SRLs to discuss with the oncologist. Caller had no further questions. Created 3rd request (499646) after the call to address his new question on how patients with PD-L1 positive status did with Opdivo. Created FLMT; was in the process of sending letters sent via email (bradstandefer@comcast.net) when he called back to discuss further. Caller wants to discuss the PD-L1 SRL I will be sending for head and neck cancer. Is there any info in it regarding survival rate for non PD-L1 patients? His Mom has ""no PD-L1 tumor exrpression at all."" Is there any data on how these patients did? Discussed Summary/Efficacy by PD-L1 expression level table (on top of page 3). Informed caller of the prespecified subgroups and that his Mom would fall in the less than 1% subgroup. Provided info specific to the less than 1% subgroup. Caller went on to state ""so the number for Opdivo is actually slightly less than standard therapy?"" Confirmed that median OS in months was 5.7 for Opdivo and 5.8 for standard therapy. Caller said ""well that is strange."" Explained that the differences were seen mostly in the higher PD-L1 expression groups. Caller confirmed understanding and will take this into account when discussing with oncologist. Caller had no further questions.
