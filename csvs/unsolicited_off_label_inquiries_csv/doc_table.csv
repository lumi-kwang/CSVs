A CK was 308 (top normal 247) but has gradually increased to 1,378 over approximately 2 weeks and trending upward. Because of the recent publication I checked cardiac markers and found elevated CK MB but normal relative index of 4-5% and troponins elevated at 0.14-0.11 and seem to be stable or trending slightly downward. EKGs and cardiac echos (2) show no acute changes. The patient is not overly symptomatic (the muscle aches are improving) and he will see a cardiologist tomorrow. Do you have any information that may help with management? Several questions come to mind:1.	If no change in clinical status, what is the appropriate timing and duration for following CK, troponin etc.?2.	Is there an acceptable way to rule in/out myocarditis   cardiac MRI?
