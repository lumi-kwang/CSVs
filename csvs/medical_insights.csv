FMI-50971|OPDIVO|Gregory Ursino|"MID-WEST
IL, IN, OH"|Access Organization|Access Influencers|"I met with a NCCN NSCLC panelist in the midwest.  He offered these insights

On OAK at ESMO he stated he and the panel viewed the data to be good, roughly like Opdivo.  On the issue of the ESMO data showing ""positive"" results in the PDL-1 negative population, we went over the issues and he stated the panel recently discussed this.  Stated there was not strong enthusiasm of panel for the PDL-1 negative argument due to reasons we discussed internally, but also due to low numbers and at this point unpublished data (he stressed this).  That said given indication of atezo unlikely to get NCCN recommendation more restrictive than label.

Agreed with just about everybody else that 026 was surprise, likely trial design, etc.

On KN 021 stated panel felt the data way to early to recommend Chemo/Pembro in any way.  Had no opinion on whether IO/IO or IO/chemo likely to be superior

Stated NCCN was working on recommendation on how to use PDL-1 cutoffs in some future statement.  This is second NCCN panelist to mention this to me.  Other was in cHL.  Stated majority of effort was in the 1-100% area (as opposed to 0-3+)  Commended BMS for working with Ventana

FMI-51622|OPDIVO|Brian Bingham||Clinical||"BCBSMI/Blue Care Network:

oAE:  How are you viewing PDL testing at this point? LS: A: ?Haven?t we killed that off in previous discussions?? She then rattled through the inconsistencies and conflicting data sets indicating that they haven?t built this into their policies beyond FDA labeling for the relevant products.
o	How do clinical trials influence medical policy/criteria?  Depending on level of evidence and applicability to our population they might be considered for significant differentiators.
o	Do you consider FDA label or NCCN guidelines more important when making policy changes? General consensus was NCCN.  AH/LC: we find the guidelines to be a better guide especially when it comes to patient/treatment nuances.
?	BCN Subject matter expert (R.Cook) has a different view on NCCN guidelines ? often too broad would prefer the restrictions of label and NCCN cat1/2A.
o	How are you considering applying the new Keytruda 1L data?etc?  Most likely to labeled indication i.e. >50%.  Likely to mandate testing for 1L usage.  
o	Overall ? we feel the customer has a good grasp on this 1L population and the applicability of the new data in light of the many options in 1L NSCLC.  
o	Tumor types appear to be very unique and specific - no clear policy shortcuts pertaining to management.
o	Key question - if they mandate testing how strong will the management be of a PA for these patients.
o	Keytruda update - will they monitor PDL1 expression in 1L and eventually mandate more >1% in 2L broadly?  Possibility in future."|11/11/2016||

FMI-50420|OPDIVO|John Lee|ND, SD, MN, IA, WI|Clinical Trial; Competitor data; Research & Development|Access Influencers; Clinical Practice Influencers|"[026 - NOT Top 300; ""opted in""]  RTL from a major academic institution mentioned that 026 was a ""dirtier"" trial than 017, 057, and KEYNOTE-024, given high crossover between each arm bleeding into the other (60% chemo-->nivo and 44% nivo-->chemo).

Due to high crossover, RTL wasn't surprised by the criss-crossing of the PFS curves...RTL believes that the majority (60%) of patients on chemo was essentially receiving nivo as 2nd line.  This is like a repeat of 057 (criss-crossing of the PFS curves) as the majority of 026 was non-squamous.

026 has NOT changed RTL's perceptions and he is still going to use nivo in the first line.  For healthy, younger patients, RTL is more inclined to use pemetrexed/carboplatin x4 cycles, then go to nivo immediately based on 026 data.

?	For 1L, further explained that Keytruda will become SOC for patients with tumor PDL1 expression ?50% (PL-based CT still best option for patients with PDL1 expression <50%).
?	For 2L, and when asked ?why Tecentriq??, explained that nivo, pembro, and atezo are all equivalent. Rationale for giving preference to Tecentriq: 1) more experience with the agent (his institution has contributed to multiple atezo trials); 2) convenience of q3w for the patients (unnecessary to see patients more frequently than q3w to ensure optimal safety; insensitive to the argument that median number of doses is similar with q2w and q3w for a majority of patients given median duration of treatment of ~3mo). ?I also love nivo, but I have no reason to use it?. ?In 2L pembro is at the bottom of the list?

?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it?s attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial."|8/12/2016||

He commented that his site in particular has several pts still on trial having great, prolonged responses. He expects that the NCCN will ultimately have pembro as a preferred option for 1L with testing required to be positive according to their trial design, and for those less than 50%, chemo will be preferred 1L with either PD1 agent as an option in 2L (based on KN 010 data).|8/12/2016||

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

-Currently, this TL believes that treatment/ sequencing decisions should be made by choosing which potential set of AEs a RCC patient is willing to endure since the AEs associated with Nivo and Cabo are so different. He concedes that oral versus IV, or physician preference of back-to-back TKIs versus sandwiching Nivo between 2 TKIs also play a role in choosing a treatment option.

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ?market? pembro as the drug of choice in the ?positive? or ?high staining? patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

Andy discussed various trial information.  We also discussed NSCLC screening, which he felt his hospital was not doing enough of.

As part of our discussion with the society staff and physician leadership, the following insights were obtained:

1. Significant dissatisfaction with BMS over the use of television marketing.  Two physicians present both indicated they felt that the use of commercials for Nivolumab was unethical.  One physician stated he felt it was ""morally irreprehensible"" and expressed extreme frustration at having to take time with patients to explain why they aren't candidates for Nivolumab that he would have been using to discuss the treatment he was going to be prescribing for them.  The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

5.  One physician did comment on treating a 90+ y/o patient with nivolumab with metastatic melanoma who decided to stop treatment after two doses.  The patient went on palliative care following that, but the physician is getting texts every 3 weeks from the patient's son indicating that the large lesion on his father's back continues to regress and the patient is doing very well.

OR,WA,N.CA"|Clinical Trial; Competitor data|Access Influencers|"Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests."|7/14/2016||

At this time we discussed the ORR across all patient populations in the trial, focusing on the >1% and >5% populations, as well as the safety profile from the 012. We discussed traditional response rates with SOC agents in the first line, focusing on platinum doublet chemo, and the toxicities associated with these agents.

Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)"|7/14/2016||ONC Lung ?

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms
?	Doesn?t want one bad experience to tarnish an oncologist?s perception of regimen"|7/14/2016||ONC Lung - Reaction and general impression of data presented at ASCO on differentiating BMS from competitors

""Newly-approved immunotherapy drugs for cancer have contributed to growing revenue at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as more patients visit the hospital for access to the life-saving treatments.

""The hospital?s net patient service revenue skyrocketed in the second quarter, according to financials released last week. For the first two quarters ending March 31, the hospital reported net patient service revenue of $441.4 million, a 23 percent increase from the two quarters the year prior.

""Hospital spokesman John Noble said the uptick is mainly because of two new immunotherapy drugs approved by the FDA toward the end of 2015 ? one for the treatment of lung and renal cell cancer called Opdivo, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and one, called Keytruda and sold by Merck & Co.

""Though the patient revenue contributed to a 17 percent increase in operating revenue to $682.4 million, the high cost of the pharmacy drugs contributed to an uptick in expenses, with operating expenses increasing 17 percent to $655 million.

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
?	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy."|6/20/2016||

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships."|10/18/2016||ONC NSCLC ?

?	After reviewing the 026 deck, AI commented that the study design was flawed. She stated they were really hoping for Nivo in an all comers population in the 1L.
?	A discussion around the discussant?s (Soria) comments/tweets at ESMO when he compared the trials (we confirmed that you can?t compare data across trials, but can look at differences in trials)
o	Differences in trial designs (CM026/KN 024)  and imbalances were discussed (never smokers, PDL1 expression differences, non-stratified PDL1 expression, cross over rates, females, health of pt pop). We discussed that Soria stated only ~10-15% of the patients in the real world would match the patient population in KN 024. 
?	This led to the question of why BMS designed their trial this way. She stated she is accustomed to BMS having stronger trials. 
?	Panelist confirmed that females do better in her experience
?	Panelist is aware of ICER, but is not participating in the review. 
?	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS? stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she?s heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She?s unsure how they will get paid. She agreed with BMS request to not be in the guidelines as their institution and BMS align in their EBM thinking.
?	AI stated the biggest unmet need for patients with 1L lung cancer is to provide an effective therapy with minimal toxicity to patients with poor PS. She stated that?s were I/O can really show it?s benefit. 012 and 227 design were reactively discussed. She?s excited about 227. 
?	She stated there?s a big education gap on the side of the patient. She feels patients are still trying to push through their IMAR. 
?	AI stated she orders both the Pembro/Nivo assays when doing PDL1 expression testing. Discussion on FDA blue print ensued. She stated, in her experience, patients rarely test for >50%. 
?	She brought up OAK being an all comers population. She didn?t comment further, and only stated, we?ll have to see if the FDA gives them an indication.

The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval)."|6/28/2016||Opdivo - Lymphoma Insights

We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.

?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.

FMI-38477|OPDIVO|Alexy Lara-Lozada|W. TN, Landscape/P, ANDSCAPE/PARADIGMS, GA|Congress Information|Scientific Experts|At a Lung Cancer Symposium in Puerto Rico there was a lot of discussion on how to distinguish pseudoprogression vs. true progression. Most agree that in patients with an increase in lesion size during treatment but clinically doing well they will continue treatment due to suspected pseudoprogression. There was less agreement regarding patients with new lesions during treatment: some believe that appearance of a new lesion is definitely a sign of true progression while others believe that a new lesion in a patient clinically doing well may also be pseudoprogression. The presenter commented that, in her opinion, appearance of a new lesion does not automatically means true progression. It can be an already existing lesion too small to be seen in radiographic images that, due to increased size after the immune response to treatment, it is now clinically detectable. Commented that she has seen this kind of response pattern and some patients can eventually respond to treatment. For the presenter, the most important thing to assess is how the patient is doing clinically. If the patient has clinical benefit and is tolerating treatment she will continue treatment even in the case of new lesions. But if the patient is clearly deteriorating (e.g. deterioration of performance status, worsening symptoms) this may indicate true progression. The presenter commented that clinical trials in Cuba allow treatment beyond initial progression if the patient has clinical benefit and is tolerating treatment.|2/26/2016||Nivolumab -NSCLC Treatment Landscape/Paradigms

FMI-38627|OPDIVO; YERVOY|Devon Hall|CENTRAL|Other|Scientific Experts|"1.	Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system"|2/28/2016||

This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis."|9/14/2016||ONC Lung ?

(no immune cells in the TME) could be related to the vasculature surrounding the tumor.  TL has unpublished data demonstrating immune cells roll along the endothelium latching onto cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) and once they encounter the appropriate chemokines from immune cells they extravasate toward the tumor.  The tumor secretes substances that effect the permeability of the endothelium making it leaky and filled with gaps. T cells can no longer adhere to the endothelium and extravasate toward tumor so they just float through the vessel away from the tumor.  This may help explain the reason why there are no immune cells within TME. He stated he has unpublished data showing that treatment with a certain VEGF inhibitor re-establishes the vasculature to more ?normal? situation and the T cells are then able to receive the chemokine signals, adhere to endothelium, extravasate and enter TME.

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.

He shared that he thought it was a favorable article at the end but it was not a ?balance of what we are up against when we are dealing with the kind of disease that kills everyone.? He shared that the article did not get at the fact that a certain amount of toxicity is the point and that generally toxicity manifestation can shorten therapy time.  He added that if colitis is seen, a few days on steroids followed by a dose of infliximab is enough to take care of it. Diabetes and endocrine issues can effect patients long-term but they are not the end of the world. He did express concern that there is under-reported joint pain and fatigue that can be seen with a PD-1 monotherapy that can last for 6- 12 months after treatment. 

He shared that there is a need for strong education of patients and that education for oncologists is needed in educating patients. He further shared a recent discussion with a community oncologist who does not see his regimen patients every three weeks (they are seen by his nurse after the first dose). He was shocked by this and emphasized the importance of not only seeing the patient before each dose but also between the 2nd and 3rd dose.

The reason for Price Protection should be self-evident in the media ? price inflation of prescription drugs has been excessive and exposes our clients to unpredictable costs when setting budgets/premiums/etc.   

As a result, clients are demanding that we enter ?fixed cost? contracts where the pricing of a product is predetermined based on a set WAC during the course of an agreement, or else a Price Protection ceiling above which the net cost effect of a manufacturer?s pricing strategy will not affect the plan?s cost for the product. 

Additionally, when looking to prefer products, Price Protection is becoming an increasingly important feature of rebate contracts. For example, if I have price protection for Xarelto and Pradaxa, but not Eliquis, clients may be inclined to select your competitors because of the predictable nature of the spend.   A single price increase by BMS/Pfizer could wipe out much or all of the rebate value for a plan over the course of a contract If they select your  product, while they can be assured that the decision to prefer the other products would make sure a plan can?t go too far astray during the life of the contract for competitors offering PP."|12/9/2016||

IL, IN, OH"|Competitor data|Access Decision Makers|"I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab"|6/24/2016||ONC Lung ?

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

On the design of 026 she felt that BMS probably had good advice given to us at ad boards when designing trial but we did not listen (she did not expand on this)

?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost."|3/25/2016||ONC Lung - Reaction and general impression of data  on differentiating BMS from competitor agents

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?"|3/25/2016||ONC Lung - The impact of PDL1 expression status on treatment decisions for NSCLC patients

Surprised at and impressed by how big the magnitude of benefit was in KN024.  Acknowledges that it is going to fit for a very small portion of patients (he estimated 20% for his practice based on his own synthesis of PDL1 prevalence reported and PS/brain mets/etc in his own patients), however think that it is worth testing everyone at diagnosis and would try to treat anyone with >50% PDL1 with pembro 1L.  He is completely perplexed by the CM026 >50% negative data.  Thinks that this is likely ?a fluke?, but given the magnitude of benefit in 024 doesn?t think that small difference in patient populations could make data from ?super positive? to ?solidly negative? between trials so ?could be a real difference?. 

Note that prior to ESMO data, TL had low expectations overall for KN024 data, thinking magnitude would likely be reasonably small and that he would not likely make a huge push to PDL1 test everyone at 1L, so this is a marked shift in his attitude after seeing data.  He was, and remains, strongly pro-nivo regardless of PDL1 expression, for 2L - views haven?t changed."|10/13/2016||ONC NSCLC ? Treatment in 1st Line NSCLC

Further explanation showed that palliative care is currently very limited in situations when patients who are on opioids with already compromised renal or liver functions and continue to benefit from IO therapy but now unable to cope with increasing muscle/bone pain. Very common for patients not to report pain to his/her oncologist in fear of discontinuation of therapy. Increasing opiods does not bring a desired pain relief and adding large doses of Tylenol or ibuprofen in the setting of other co-morbidities may not be an option for these patients. The most common outcome for patient  was discontinuation of opdivo therapy.
This attending also expressed a desire for a specific care manual with emphasis on challenging supportive care situations in the setting of immune therapies.

NYC, CT, NJ"|Competitor data|Access Influencers; Scientific Experts|"A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance"|4/15/2016||ONC Lung - Reaction and general impression of data  on differentiating BMS from competitor agents
