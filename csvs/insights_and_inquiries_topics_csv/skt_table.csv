?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests.",898

?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.
?	He mentioned that the NCCN NSCLC panel has been busy with recent updates with Pembro and consideration of Atezo data, with emails flying around the group.","The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?","I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab",1862

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC
o	In the context of a debate, she stated that PD1 agents should be the standard of care for initial therapy in SQ NSCLC specifically.
o	She expressed that with CM 026 specificially in SQ NSCLC, based upon the subgroup HR analysis, the PFS was still higher than in CM 017.  
o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.
o	She pointed to the much lower grade 3-4 AE?s seen with chemo compared to chemotherapy.","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.

TL also stated that levatanib+everolimus was 'junk' and that nobody is using it.","Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests.","GU TL shared his treatment-decision algorithm in RCC:
1L - VEGF TKI (currently pazopanib, but though CABO-SUN looked goog)
2L -  based on how responded to 1L TKI:   if tox was modest AND patient had strong response (not just SD) lasting for >6month --> TKI (cabozatanib).  If substantial tox, or low/short duration response in 1L TKI --> nivo.

Stated that about 60% of patients get nivo 2L, 30% cabo, 10% 'other'. Does not use levatanib+everolimus.  

TL stated 'reality is that none of these agents, including IO, are probably going to cure the vast majority patients. So our goal is really to string them together as best as we can and importantly, don't use an agent for too long such that pt crashes and can't get to the agent""",811

?	BMS moves of its therapeutic agents from 2L to 1L setting is too precipitous and scientifically unsound. In 1L setting what matters most is that treatment offers some benefit to as many patients who receive it as possible, not that treatment offers substantial benefit to a small fraction of patients and nothing to another larger fraction of treated patients.","A LAI/RTL/former melanoma NCCN panelist/Assoc. Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",203

Although data from KEYNOTE-024 shows an importance for the PD-L1 expression, he's NOT likely to have everyone test for PD-L1, wait for results, then go to pembro if they are very high expressors.  Because of this hassle, LTL is very hesitant to implement PD-L1 expression into clinical practice without seeing results from 227.

LTL is just fine with chemo x4 cycles, then go straight to nivo and bypass PD-L1 testing.","[026 - Top 300] LTL from a large community institution mentioned that the data from 026 does NOT impact his current use of nivolumab in second line, especially since 026 had such a high crossover rate.

LTL mentioned that chemo still has its place in the front-line setting: pem/carbo for non-squamous and gem/cis for squamous.

While he recognized the number was considerably lower for nivo, he commented that nivo tox can be overall more difficult to manage and potentially more severe than chemo related tox. Specifically, he noted that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (accounting for nearly 20% of G3/4 chemo tox) are both generally very easy to manage and aren't considered a big deal. Anemia (almost 20% of G3/4 for chemo) is a little tougher but still not as bad as potentially life-threatening pneumonitis or some of the other issues that PD1 therapy can bring on. Lung docs are very familiar and comfortable with chemo toxicities and even when falling into G3/4 levels of severity, heme-related tox isn't a big deal to them.",2122

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.

""Hospital spokesman John Noble said the uptick is mainly because of two new immunotherapy drugs approved by the FDA toward the end of 2015 ? one for the treatment of lung and renal cell cancer called Opdivo, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and one, called Keytruda and sold by Merck & Co.

""Though the patient revenue contributed to a 17 percent increase in operating revenue to $682.4 million, the high cost of the pharmacy drugs contributed to an uptick in expenses, with operating expenses increasing 17 percent to $655 million.

o	Garnering interest from Interest Industry (Lilly-Celgene) / Clinicians","I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab","Increasing tone from AI's on national pathways that the -026 press release and the -057 data has influenced the value discussion around ""all comer"" indications in 2L NSCLC. These individuals are currently seeking to generate pathways that restrict the use of IO to only those expressing PDL1 in NSCLC.",21

They are not looking to manage PD1 inhibitors by PDL1 expression levels. He indicated the science is too new and there are too many unanswered questions.  Payor stated the PDL1 expression is informative, but not definitive. PDL1 expression is not in the PA criteria yet. He stated there is not an ICD10 code for PDL1 expression (+/-).","NTL in midwest stated at her institution they generally push trials, especially after first line.  That said she stated in second line they almost always use Nivo over pembro.  She felt even though Roche had some ""iffy"" data in PDL-1 neg she felt it was minor and still thought her institution would use Nivo second line.

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it?s attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial.",173

In their institution-specific pathway, they are already using pembrolizumab as their preferred agent for PD-L1 positive patients, with a cutoff of PD-L1>1%.  Upon being challenged by the HSL for the rationale for this low cut off for pembrolizumab in second line, he pointed to Keynote 10 data where patients with PD-L1>1% did better than docetaxel.

o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.

o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.
o	She pointed to the much lower grade 3-4 AE?s seen with chemo compared to chemotherapy.","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.

?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).

Things are very different in the 1L setting ? results from a phase III RCT are typically required to displace or compete with a SOC that has been validated in phase III RCTs. The NCCN panel for lung received some flack in the past for having prematurely given a broad recommendation for Tarceva in the 1L, and then having to back track. Now everybody is more cautious.","A regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory indicated that medical oncologists for lung at this institution try to test all patients for PD-L1 expression at diagnosis, but they do so more to increase their understanding of when/how PD-L1 inhibitors work than to make 2L treatment decisions. ?But it is a fight: pathologists constantly push back against PD-L1 testing, though typically not for the right reasons? (because testing for PD-L1 expression erodes their benefit as they receive a set fee to test tumor biopsies for biomarkers and all biopsies are tested for EGFR and ALK abnormalities).","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",2232

Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",210

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.  He mentioned Nivo impacted both treatment groups as the mOS for chemo due to crossover and single agent Nivo are better than historical controls.","Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.

Both nivo and pembro are good, but there is no role for nivo in 1L NSCLC at this point.","NP with experience using Nivo and Pembro in NSCLC stated that difference between results of CM-026 and KN-024 could potentially be explained entirely by schedule of 1st scan: 6w for CM-026 and 9w for KN-024.  NP said she can usually tell within a few weeks if patient is responding to chemo, but feels it takes a bit longer to see responses to PD1 inhibitors.  NP feels it's likely the 1st 6wk scan was too early to detect some of the responses to Nivo. Those patients would be classified as progressors. So the response rate to Nivo was underestimated and the progression rate on Nivo was overestimated.  Whereas most responses to chemo would have occurred by 6w, so that response rate and progression rate was probably more accurate.","At a national conference, panelists seemed in agreement that differences in CM-026 and KN-024 could be explained by differences in patient populations.

?	 Suggested that the following factors probably contributed to the negative results: inclusion of very low PDL1 expressors and low power resulting in major imbalances between groups. 
?	Commented that the PFS KM curves were baffling. Asked if pseudoprogressions in the nivo arm might have played a role (noted that pseudoprogressions seem to be rarer with NSCLC than melanoma, but first follow-up assessment in CM-026 took place early at 6 wks).
?	Suggested that nivo had shown no clinical activity in CM-026. After being reminded that PFS, OS, and ORR were similar in both study arms, agreed that it was more appropriate to conclude that nivo had an efficacy similar to that of CT in PDL1 ?5% NSCLC, with a better safety profile.",604

?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.

o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.

o	Checkpoint inhibition is relevant biologically
o	Sophisticated pre-clinical testing in animal models demonstrated biologic relevance
o	PDL1+ expressers demonstrate higher response in many different cancers
?	057 KM curves by PDL1 show higher response for higher expressers
?	017 not same, but different beast
?	012 shows higher response in higher expressors
o	the problem is not PDL1 (a good test), it?s Pharma that has confused with different cuts of data, etc.
o	PDL1 (life cycle of PDL1 as biomarker), PDL1 testing validated in 1st and 2L NSCLC
o	PD1 oversold as good for everybody, but actually only good for smaller percentages
o	Checkpoint IO only cost effective when they are employed for pts most likely to benefit (defined as predictive biomarker)

?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.",153

Things are very different in the 1L setting ? results from a phase III RCT are typically required to displace or compete with a SOC that has been validated in phase III RCTs.

(because testing for PD-L1 expression erodes their benefit as they receive a set fee to test tumor biopsies for biomarkers and all biopsies are tested for EGFR and ALK abnormalities).","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",2232

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo.

Regional lung TL,Segmentation, Scientific Experts,62.011409943,7.52086476458e-09,43,1779,"Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)",Regional lung TL voluntarily shared that there will be an upcoming poster at ASCO as well as a publication in process (JAMA) regarding patients with autoimmune diseases and treatment with immunotherapy,Regional lung TL voluntarily shared that he has recently received a grant specific to looking at patients with autoimmune diseases and the use of I-O agents in this population,1822

unnecessary,Segmentation, Scientific Experts,54.2599837001,9.88746733544e-08,8,9,Community RTL feels the challenge with testing all patients in 1L setting is surgeon/pathologist misunderstanding on importance of PDL1 testing and collecting enough tissue at biopsy and not wasting tissue performing unnecessary stains in determining histology. RTL said it would not be a problem to to have patients undergo second biopsy if not enough tissue available.,Complete change in perception regarding PDL1 testing in NSCLC over last year - went from believing needed to test patients based on MOA and cost rationale to using clinical experience determine that PDL1 status is unnecessary for treatment decisions (had patients respond who were PDL1 non expressors). Now only tests when planning on using Opdivo in a non-indicated disease states.,Lung RTL shared that she is stretching out her scans past the 8 week mark.  She feels a majority of her patients are receiving clinical benefit (i.e. stable disease) but the early scan doesn't help much.  In fact she says that it probably induces unnecessary anxiety in pts. and they get discouraged when they hear that nothing much has changed with their scans.,17

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
?	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy.","NTL from podium spoke very positively of IO and Regimen (most data discussed from Nivo studies):
1)	We have 10y OS data with Yervoy and this will probably be even longer with Regimen.  Pts don?t want a response ?they want to be on the tail in of the curve?.  He stated with Regimen and other IO combinations that ?hopefully we?ll be talking to pts about a 30y OS plan in the future?
2)	Regimen 
a.	Presented data from -069 and -067 showing the PFS curve stating ?you don?t need statistics to tell the difference in the curve favoring regimen?. 
b.	Toxicity is a concern and for older pts he chooses single agent PD1
c.	Regimen demonstrates similar activity in PDL1- pts
d.	TL stated uses Regimen every day in the clinic and has seen some spectacular results.  It?s an ?excellent Regimen?.  Very potent regimen
3)	Stated the immune response is very rapid with PD1 agents and especially regimen
4)	PDL1 as biomarker:
a.	PDL1+ pts tend to have better responses across tumor types
b.	Showed Nivo OS curves in PDL+/- pts and stated most of the advantage is in PDL1+ pts.  However, he stated you ?don?t want to withhold nivolumab treatment based on PDL1 expression levels bc PDL1- pts can have significant benefit as well?
c.	He stated mutational load may be the best biomarker
d.	Pts with high levels of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment and invasive margins tend to have better responses
e.	No T cells within in tumor microenvironment pts don?t seem to respond as well and this is an area ?we as researchers need to improve T cell recruitment with novel combinations of injectables/vaccines (referenced TVEC)
5)	Need to identify agents that have activity in checkpoint resistant pts ? TL has had success with adoptive T cell transfer with approximately 30% RR although the RR drops in checkpoint resistant pts from 50% (checkpoint naïve) to about 30%.","RTL said for 2L NSCLC, the Q3W schedule for Atezo is the differentiating factor, and that he put his most recent patient on Atezo. However, he thinks we?ll still have majority market share based on prior experience.",312
NAI,Segmentation, Scientific Experts,46.5085574572,1.26537545288e-06,7,393,"During a brief conversation at a CME event, a national/regional AI and advisor to NCCN panelist for NSCLC at an academic center from the South HSL territory provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should not be used as single agents in NSCLC patients with zero PD-L1 expression, including in the adjuvant setting. Ongoing studies are likely to show that patients with zero PD-L1 expression should be treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor + chemo (or ipi) combination therapies.
?	In the 1L setting, platinum-based chemotherapy will remain the SOC for now.
?	Does not support the idea of going beyond PD-L1 +/- in NCCN guidelines at this point.","An academic NAI, advisor to an NCCN panelist for lung shared the following unsolicited insights during a discussion around an ISR:
?	IO agents in general, and PD1 inhibitors in particular, are involved in nearly all of the important new developments for lung cancer treatment. Highly promising single-agent and combination therapy options are emerging in the NSCLC frontline setting and for the treatment of recurrent SCLC.
?	Results presented at ASCO are not mature enough yet to warrant updating current NCCN clinical guidelines for lung cancer. The right time to do this should be about 6 months from now if/when present results are confirmed.","An academic NAI, advisor to an NCCN panelist for lung shared the following unsolicited insights during a discussion around an ISR:
?	?What matters the most is what happens with regard to the right tail of the survival curves. If OS benefits are maintained over time, nivolumab might become an ideal agent for post-frontline maintenance therapy in NSCLC. Needs in this setting are extremely high since pemetrexed is the only agent currently available for nsq NSCLC and there is no approved treatment option for sq NSCLC?.",400
Academic TL,Segmentation, Scientific Experts,44.9582722086,2.34042800361e-27,66,1696,"Post 026 release:
- 2 NTL and 2 RTL mentioned that had BMS selected a different PDL-1 cut-off the 026 trial may have been positive, perception is NOT that nivo is less effective than pembro from the 026 read-out
-  2 RTLs have stated that PFS may not have been the best endpoint and are waiting for OS readout
-  1 community TL and 2 academic TLs stated that they currently have patients who are asking for 1L monotherapy pembro based on the 024 press release, some patients are willing to pay out of pocket for treatment vs enrolling in clinical trials
-  1 RTL was less optimistic stating ?you shot yourselves in the foot by selecting a 5% cut-point and endpoint of PFS?.  Combo therapy (ipi+nivo) will have to demonstrate ?cure? or high % of CR to compete against monotherapy pembro in + expressers based on a more favorable toxicity profile
-  Consensus from academic to community TLs stating that they see pem and nivo as being the same and the Q3week is the key advantage that pembro has despite the differences in trial design because they now have a better understanding of MOA, activity, and safety in a collection of trials across nivo and pembro","NTL in lung stated that he was ""neither surprised nor discouraged' but CM-026 not meeting its primary endpoint.  He did however, applaud BMS ""for doing the RIGHT study, not the easy study"". He shared that, with the data we had at the time this study was started, it was absolutely a reasonable design, albeit a very lofty goal.  He is confident that once sub-analyses are run at higher cutoffs in CM026 that the data will look just as good as pembro, and ""maybe you'll even be able to show that cutoff should be 25% not 50%"", and that ""even without an indication I'd use nivo 1L if the identified population if the data was good enough""",Academic TL mentioned the community lung TLs are testing for PDL-1 because they believe pembro is more effective in PDL1+ patients.  He said that because we do not need to test there seems to be a perceived absence of benefit in the positive expressers.  He stated that when he shared with the community TLs BMS's data in the PDL1 >5% and >10% they were very surprised and frustrated to why they have not heard of the data but will likely switch to nivo.,1762

While he recognized the number was considerably lower for nivo, he commented that nivo tox can be overall more difficult to manage and potentially more severe than chemo related tox. Specifically, he noted that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (accounting for nearly 20% of G3/4 chemo tox) are both generally very easy to manage and aren't considered a big deal. Anemia (almost 20% of G3/4 for chemo) is a little tougher but still not as bad as potentially life-threatening pneumonitis or some of the other issues that PD1 therapy can bring on. Lung docs are very familiar and comfortable with chemo toxicities and even when falling into G3/4 levels of severity, heme-related tox isn't a big deal to them.","Local lung TL commented that when it comes to Q3W dosing convenience, you truly get two completely different preferences based on who you talk to. In her opinion, having experience treating pts at a city-based, academic cancer center as well as a more rural satellite clinic, those pts that are being seen in the smaller satellites are usually in favor of coming to the office more often due to the social aspects of it (often older population without day jobs), whereas those that are being seen at academic centers want to come in less frequently due to other responsibilities or the hassle of parking, travel, etc.",Regional lung TL commented that he was stunned by how much of an overreaction there has been to the 026 study.

Things are very different in the 1L setting ? results from a phase III RCT are typically required to displace or compete with a SOC that has been validated in phase III RCTs. The NCCN panel for lung received some flack in the past for having prematurely given a broad recommendation for Tarceva in the 1L, and then having to back track. Now everybody is more cautious.","A regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory indicated that medical oncologists for lung at this institution try to test all patients for PD-L1 expression at diagnosis, but they do so more to increase their understanding of when/how PD-L1 inhibitors work than to make 2L treatment decisions. ?But it is a fight: pathologists constantly push back against PD-L1 testing, though typically not for the right reasons? (because testing for PD-L1 expression erodes their benefit as they receive a set fee to test tumor biopsies for biomarkers and all biopsies are tested for EGFR and ALK abnormalities).","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",2232

Has used nivo in 3 patients with non-clear cell RCC; 1 did extremely well. Some payers are reluctant to pay for such off-guideline treatments; other do not cause any problem. Would support the extension of nivo recommendation to non-clear cell RCC in NCCN guidelines and compendium.","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",741

- pace of progression (20% of pts exhibiting faster progression prefers TKI) 
- toxicity of 1L VEGF TKI (if had minimal tox/dose reduction, more likely to give cabo 2L due to convience of oral dosing)
- compliance to taking oral meds and reporting of side effects

When review -026 trial design many express surprise that Nivo had a PdL1 restriction in the trial design. They then emphasize the problems with pdl1 testing and why they like Nivo in 2L is because it is unrestricted. State the main differentiating factor in 1L given both Nivo and pembro will require testing is which company makes the testing process easier/faster/more understandable.,59

When thinking about 1L NSCLC TL believes PDL1 testing will be required across all agents, hence the differentiating factor will be the agent with the most diagnostic support to help practitioners establish SOPs for ordering and understanding the PDL1 diagnostic.","TL was very upset that BMS had ""such a stupid trial design for 1L NSCLC."" Specifically pointing out the PFS endpoint and treatment arm imbalances.  In addition, TL was upset that they are now forced to test for PD-L1 status even though the assays are complicated and not fully established. When asked about testing the TL stated they solely leave the process to the pathologists stating they call the pathologist and say ""I want to use pembro in 1L test PDL1."" Further TL was upset because does not want to be in a position to decide on treatment if less than 50% but close to the threshold (e.g 45-50%, below 45 they were very clear they would choose chemo). Nivo was still regarded as the agent of choice for 2L.","TL applauded BMS for its scientific integrity and rigor. However, given the 1L data states that Merck applied a smart strategy with their approach. Specifically stating that using the PDL1 biomarker in a restricted population proved the utility of the biomarker and established its utility to select for patient's with maximal benefit. The approach is one that many physicians feel very good about because they feel their treatment has a higher likelihood of impact and that they are using the agent in an appropriate patient. In addition, payers like the approach because of the clear value in these patients. Hence, Merck has generated a more clear and useful message regarding the use of IO, compared with the the more muddled/confusing idea of using IO in an all comer population for mixed efficacy/value results.",21

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",312

single agent Nivo,Territory, CENTRAL,153.510638298,1.0324830954e-09,20,1382,"RCC TL and I discussed recent approvals of Cabo and Lenvantinib versus Nivo and how they all will fit into the treatment landscape.  He stated in rapidly progressing pts or pts with significant burden of disease he may go with Cabo. We reactively we reviewed the data from the Motzer ASCO GU presentation discussing outcomes based on key baseline therapies that overall describes the superiority of Nivo in all pt subgroups including poor prognostic risk categories, number/sites of mets, and prior therapies.  We also discussed the dynamics of response with TKIs versus IO agents like nivolumab specifically durability of response and consistent OS advantage across phase 3 studies.  He was impressed with data and stated Nivo is 2nd line SOC in all subgroups plus the toxicity profile for Nivo is far superior to other agents.  This seemed to solidify his preference of Nivo over Cabo in all pts including rapidly progressing pt pop.  Tl was not impressed with Lenvantinb and thought it had significant toxicities in combo with everolimus (late line option).","General trend emerging through multiple TL engagements:  Duration of treatment - how long to treat pts who have achieved CR or deep, durable PR.  Based on data presented at ASCO demonstrating pts respond after discontinuation of regimen or single agent Nivo, TLs are asking when is it appropriate to stop treatment.  This appears to be a hypothetical discussion at this point. I've only had a couple TLs mention they have pts on Nivo in CR for years and they have discontinued Nivo.  TLs have stated if pt achieved CR and maintained for 6 months to a year they would consider discontinuing treatment.",TL stated it is impressive that 70% of pts treated with regimen continued to respond even in the absence of the medication.  The question is what to do with the pts who have durable responses for long periods of time.  Next wave of research studies should evaluate the discontinuation of regimen or single agent Nivo for pts who have responded for long periods of time (CR or very deep PR) and retreatment upon progression.,1402
robust,Territory, CENTRAL,143.276595745,6.33158635887e-08,15,49,"Several RTLs have mentioned they have been discussing with their colleagues unexpected responses observed post-Nivo. TLs state pts treated with Nivo who eventually progress (after a response or SD) or sometimes progress straight through Nivo are then treated with standard agents such as gem or docetaxel that go onto have a very robust response. TL thinks that although pts progressed in Nivo, it may have changed the tumor microenvironment or sensitized them to respond better to chemo. They said in the 3rd line setting with standard agents they've used for years they are seeing more robust responses post-Nivo.","During Lung poster session, TL stated ""Nivolumab is everywhere"". Every poster and data set people are talking is Nivo related. He shared with another TL that BMS ""did it right"" when developing Nivo and designing our trials. He stated BMS took a risk by going straight to phase 3 in all comers with single agent Nivo against SOC and it has paid off. This separates BMS from competitors bc more robust data and you don't have to test. All companies ask him how he will positions these agents in 2nd line and he said he'll choose the agent with robust OS and no testing any day of week. He said that may change in front line but Nivo will be so entrenched by that point it will be tough to change.","NTL mentioned he could not believe Lenvatinib plus everolimus was FDA approved for RCC.  He said ?I was astonished it gained approval for phase 2 data?.  He said the combination is very toxic (diarrhea) requiring numerous dose modifications.  The level of evidence for Nivo is far more robust with phase 3 data and the tolerability is much better, so he?ll choose Nivo over TKIs.",64

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.

NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system","Melanoma RTL stated you need to approach treating a pt with regimen with flexibility.  First, make sure the patient is a good candidate (PS, comorbidities, can they tolerate).  Secondly, some pts may tolerate all 4 doses with no issue while others may have significant toxicity after 1 dose requiring discontinuation, but patient may respond to just 1 dose.  Physicians need to assure the patients may continue to respond after treatment or even when they discontinue the medicine.  TL referred to ASCO data where pts where off treatment and continued to respond durability.  She stated we need to under the biological underpinnings of these types observations.  What baseline immune characteristics allow one pt to only tolerate 1 dose and another patient can tolerate all 4 doses with no issue.  TL also stated BMS needs more studies looking at when to discontinue Regimen or single agent Nivo for pts who have achieved deep response and maintained it for a period of time.",RTL stated BMS should investigate Nivo as a bladder-sparing approach prior to cystectomy in the following pt populations:  1) superficial bladder cancer 2) muscle invasive stage 4 lymph node involvement chemo+Nivo (stated there?s more risk with this approach).  Neoadjuvant treatment prior to cystectomy may eliminate/reduce comorbidities associated with cystectomy and could be part of the clinical endpoint.,80

He stated the clinical data for rAd-IFN/Syn3 looks promising.  He also discussed the potential of investigating this combo in BCG-refractory pts.,TL stated it is impressive that 70% of pts treated with regimen continued to respond even in the absence of the medication.

  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance","During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from 5 NCCN panelists or NTLs regarding the evolving NSCLC management landscape, with particular focus on KN-024, CM-026, and PD-L1 testing.

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms
?	Doesn?t want one bad experience to tarnish an oncologist?s perception of regimen",1100

- Raised concerns of converting patients to flat dose during this transition period.
  - In particular those patients who are on yearly or two-year prior authorizations
    - Will insurance companies rescind PAs due to label update?
    - Will they come back and deny claims with continued use of weight-based dosing in a previously approved indication?

In a separate note we discussed the Opdvio value/cost story across inpatient vs outpatient contexts.
--Of particular note, in an inpatient setting where Opdivo is not on Formulary (as is the case with Upstate Medical Center) a patient that is on Opdivo would likely have his/her dose with held during the stay.  The patient may be managed with chemo instead until discharge",16

Spoke about blueprint data and the slide from asco 2015 showing difference in PDL1 expression on top vs bottom of the slide
3.	Explained that one of his patients tested 0% PDL1+ before chemo and then tested again after chemo and was 90% PDL1
a.	He said in general PDL1 test(s) are currently inadequate; UPMC performs two different tests (different platforms - Ventana/Dako 22C3) to confirm expression
4.	He said he doesn?t really know about the pathology details around which clone of antibody used for PDL1 test
5.	Discussed the 026 data at ESMO and the H&N approval and placement on the VIA pathways
6.	We spoke about 227 design and combo dosing moving forward
7.	He asked if we are still using a 1% or 5% cutoff in 227
8.	Talked about phase I vs Phase III data deciding factor for nivo vs pembro in H&N pathway

o	He said trials/populations are different, but didn?t regard the two agents differently
?	Lung Testing for PDL1
o	Hershey sends all testing out; currently not doing it in house though the goal is to internalize the process in the future
o	While the ?holy grail? of cancer therapy is targeting a specific biomarker, we have a long way to go regarding a good biomarker; PDL1 is not ideal for sure
o	They are able to get enough tissue for PDL1 testing. Tissue procurement is not an issue for them in lung
o	He said if a patient is 45% or greater PDL1 he might try to get them pembro
o	If 50% or higher no brainer to get pembro
o	He expects the % of patients that will be positive (>50%) to be lower than the CM-024 study %
?	1L Treatment
o	Has no problem treating a 1st line patient with chemo is they have a good PS. 
o	When patients get to second line, they are much worse PS and won?t be able to get chemo and IO becomes a much better option
o	They see very few EGFR and alk patients
o	They get the traditional heavy smoker and drinker
o	They haven?t been seeing many stage III lung patients, either get very early or very late patients
?	IO agents are overall very safe from and overall AE standpoint
o	Has run into some hypothyroid but he said it is very easy to manage
o	Has seen 1-2 cases of colitis but managed with dose interrupt and steroids
o	No hypophysitis/hepatitis or pneumonitis

o	Views Nivo has a ?bridge? to Allo transplant ? however data is not clear
o	Believes Nivo will definitely have a role in earlier lines of therapy, but is cautions to make assertions in the absence of appropriate data
?	Still waiting on further data regarding adding Brent to AVD therapy, in the absence of Bleomycin. Is interested in doing so, but would feel comfortable with more data. They did participate in the clinical trial, so it?s not totally out of her line of comfort.",73

  - In particular those patients who are on yearly or two-year prior authorizations
    - Will insurance companies rescind PAs due to label update?
    - Will they come back and deny claims with continued use of weight-based dosing in a previously approved indication?

refused,Territory, GA,27.2053239381,6.87114136924e-08,19,16,"A regional lung TL shared two stories with me about her nivolumab patients: one patient was coming in for their 50th dose of Nivo and was approaching the 2 year landmark.  She said this person has had a tremendous response and no toxicities, and that he refuses to stop therapy.  Another lung patient had a CR and elected to stop treatment--he progressed after 6 months and is going back into remission after re-treatment.  After this experience, she said that she is only encouraging patients to treat until disease progression and not for their ""convenience"" of stopping therapy.","A regional GU TL shared that he ""loves"" cabozantinib for RCC because of its tremendous activity--he noted great reponses in 6th line+ patients.  When asked about his treatment of choice for 1st line RCC, he said that it was Nivolumab.  He said that he does not like to use VEGF-TKIs upfront and has been getting 1st line Nivo approved even without the FDA indication.  He then uses cabo 2nd line and said that he refuses to use Lenvima due to added cost and the lack of Phase III validation.","A community RTL commented that Biodesix, a diagnostic company doing tests on peripheral blood to detect presence of most common actionable mutations in lung cancer are providing a centrifuge to doctor's clinics.  He refused to take the hurdle, would prefer to send the patient to a lab for collection and handling.",35
Regional TL,Territory, GA,26.0769925306,2.1763750666e-30,101,1822,Academic RTL shared that results of pdl1 testing in 1L setting would not influence or change her choice of IO in 2L setting (if patient did not meet 50% threshold and received chemo upfront). She commented that results of KN024/CM026 do not change her perception/experience with nivo in 2L unselected setting. She would not preferentially treat a known pdl1 positive patient with pembro and an unknown/pdl1- patient with nivo.,Academic RTL shared his reason for favoring nivolumab in NSCLC is the fact that there is no requirement to test. He also felt PDL1 testing in 1L is not ideal as we would likely miss patients who are PDL1- and could derive tremendous benefit over chemotherapy and receiving nivolumab would not preclude a patient from being treated with chemotherapy is they did not respond to anti-PD1,An academic RTL shared that in clinical practice a challenge he is faced with is patients with BRAF mutation that progress on BRAFi often have brain mets that require RT and steroids. This impacts the ability to initiate immunotherapy in these patients due to the requirement to be on less than 10mg prednisone equivalents,1923
Tecentriq,Territory, GA,25.262086514,7.27719945598e-06,14,859,"A pharmacist at one of the highest volume Opdivo-using sites in my geography called me asking to differentiate Opdivo from Tecentriq.  His practice is considering adopting more pathways and the physicians are asking him how to help distinguish PD1 inhibitors from PDL1 inhibitors.  He expressed that he did not know who to contact for Pembro or Atezo, so he was relying on his relationship with BMS to help guide him.","Regional lung TL stated that while he would be likely to use pembro 1L for high expressors, he would still prefer nivo in 2L because of the lack of testing requirement and his comfort with the drug. He did comment that atezo could make things interesting given that they have activity in all-comers and have us beat on dosing with the q3w convenience stating that ""q3 will always win over q2"". He views all 3 agents as having basically the same activity and same toxicity.",A Lung NTL told me that he has heard the Foundation is using the Ventana SP142 antibody to fulfill requests for some of its PD-1 testing results.  The TL is aware of the Project Blueprint data and does not believe this test should be used.  The TL noted that this might hurt Merck since the SP142 test seems to read consistently lower than the Dako tests and could turn >50% staining to less than and thus out of label for Pembro.  TL went on to say this might effect BMS also since some physicians have been reserving Opdivo for patients with PD-L1 negative tests and Atezolizumab with its q3w dosing might be desirable.,873
initially,Territory, GA,23.9325030133,2.14188779778e-09,27,0,"Following up on a previous insight from MB regarding the EA6134 trial, an melanoma NTL from MD relayed a conversation he had recently with Novartis.  The reason by the trial hold / insufficient drug supply resulted from unexpected greater commercial demand for the drugs.  GSK initially transferred the remaining inventory of the BRaf/Mek inhibitors to Novartis which allocated a small fraction for R&D purposes.  Novartis has been unable to get their own production going.  They asked GSK to make some additional drug but this will take time.  All Novartis would commit to was that drugs would be available for the trial sometime after April 1st.  The TL added that he did not expect the drugs to show up in April and had no clear idea when they would be available.","A TL told me that his site is participating in the IMvigor010 (Phase III Study of Atezolizumab Treatment Versus Observation as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With PD-L1 Positive, High Risk Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer After Cystectomy) and that initially enrollment was very low due to a requirement for the tumor to express PD-L1.  Genentech modified the protocol in the last few months to include patients with zero Pd-L1 staining.","A local HCP shared with me that he will start a melanoma patient on pembrolizumab next week.  When asked why he chose pembro, he said that he called a national melanoma TL in-state for an opinion--he initially wanted to give the regimen to this patient.  This TL lives 2.5 hours away and does not think that the regimen should be given in the community setting; she also believes that q3w trumps q2w and that is why she advised this physician to give pembro instead.",27
truly,Territory, GA,23.5779474131,1.45996567177e-07,21,486,"RTL stated that he has a patient post ASCT, post Brent, who is 4 years out of Brent therapy and slowly relapsing. THe patient cannot go to Allo because he is a Jehovah's Witness, so the TL feels that if he is truly relapsing, that he will consider using Opdivo in this patient. He had a good response on BV therapy, and feels he would also have a good response to Opdivo.",NTL shared opinion that the success of KN024 was in large part due to superior biomarker strategy by Merck and a lack of strategy by BMS in truly defining a patient population for 1L setting,"A local TL said that he recently attended a speaker training session for Tecentriq with roughly 40 other physician speakers.  He said that he was stunned by how many physicians truly do not understand the MOA and the differences between PD1 inhibition and PDL1 inhibition.  He said that even after the training session was over, he still did not feel as if the physicians appreciated that there were differences between the agents.",507
atezolizumab,Territory, GA,23.457651763,7.22521754383e-13,40,530,TL mentioned that he is participating in an atezolizumab + bendamustine or atezolizumab + CHOP for FL & DLBCL patients. He mentioned that there have been no infusion related reactions with atezolizumab and no added toxicities so far in his patients.,Community RTL mentioned that he believes Genentech will be amending current 1L NSCLC atezolizumab clinical trials where platinum doublet is comparator arm to account for new standard of care for 50%+ PDL1 patients to receive pembro,"NTL shared opinion that there is no difference between nivo, pembro, atezolizumab and if nivo would have been substituted for pembro in KN24, the trial would have read out the same (noting that the success was simply due to patient selection and 22C3 being a better assay).",570

On the other hand, RTL was curious on why the 1% PD-L1 level was chosen.

Since pembrolizumab's approval in first-line, the infusion clinics at NTL's institution have been getting busier with longer wait times and a bigger queue volume.  NTL mentioned that the longer q3w dosing of pembro/atezo in second-line shortens the queue, which is why he uses it.

Reactively highlighted CheckMate 384 (CA209-384) that compares 240 mg q2w vs. 480 mg q4w when NTL asked if there were any trials/plans to look at extended dosing.  NTL was relieved that we're investigating that for patients in the community.",9

SE,Territory, IN,320.122340426,3.27997440828e-06,3,0,"I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab","I attended the APSHO (Advanced Practitioner Society for Hematology and Oncology) JADPRO conference. Some impressions:
General presentation of immunotherapy: TL for Fox Chase presented the question: are Checkpoint Antibodies Interchangeable?  And answered, ""no meaningful clinical differences (within class) to date."" 
Head and Neck:  TL from Dana-Farber presented data from KN-012, noted it was approved on Phase 1 data based on ORR. Then presented CM 141, stressed that it was the first phase 3 data with primary endpoint of OS and approval was imminent.  Also stressed the favorable PROs noted on this study. He currently has a patient receiving Nivolumab that is responding well despite comorbidity of Hepatitis C. IMAR management presented, only unusual comment was IO agent held or discontinued for Grade 3-4 hyperthyroidism.

If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy).

?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",741

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab","Eduard Goldenberg and I met with a NCCN SCCC panelist.  On general Opdivo in lung he offered these insights:

On PDL-1 expression, when discussing the indications and trial designs of the current 2 agents, he proactively stated that felt rather strongly that the way the trials were designed should guide how the agents are used.  In discussing potential first line use, he stated that as pembrolizumab is being studied in this setting in the greater than 50% staining population, then pembro really should be limited in it?s use in that population.  He stated that if Nivo is studied in greater than 5% (or 1%), then Nivo should be used in that population.  He did not feel one agent should be used in a manner that was supported by another agents data

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ?market? pembro as the drug of choice in the ?positive? or ?high staining? patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

Andy discussed various trial information.  We also discussed NSCLC screening, which he felt his hospital was not doing enough of.

Greg Ursino","I met with NCCN panelist in NSCLC  He shared the following

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it?s attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial.","Met with PT, med policy committee of regional payer in midwest.  On the PDL-1 testing front they admitted they were not savvy enough in their claims edits to limit payment for only above 50%.  So for example as of now pembro first line would be paid if PDL-1 positive to any extent",695

He will be submitting to Blood soon.,RTL at a large academic center stated that he is interested in research in the Cord Blood population to induced GVL effect.  In this type of tranplant there is a lack of mature lymphocytes given post blood transplant.  CTLA4 and PDL 1 inhibition would be option to increase lymphocyte involvement.

On OAK at ESMO he stated he and the panel viewed the data to be good, roughly like Opdivo.  On the issue of the ESMO data showing ""positive"" results in the PDL-1 negative population, we went over the issues and he stated the panel recently discussed this.  Stated there was not strong enthusiasm of panel for the PDL-1 negative argument due to reasons we discussed internally, but also due to low numbers and at this point unpublished data (he stressed this).  That said given indication of atezo unlikely to get NCCN recommendation more restrictive than label.

Agreed with just about everybody else that 026 was surprise, likely trial design, etc.

On KN 021 stated panel felt the data way to early to recommend Chemo/Pembro in any way.  Had no opinion on whether IO/IO or IO/chemo likely to be superior

Stated NCCN was working on recommendation on how to use PDL-1 cutoffs in some future statement.  This is second NCCN panelist to mention this to me.  Other was in cHL.  Stated majority of effort was in the 1-100% area (as opposed to 0-3+)  Commended BMS for working with Ventana

He stated at his institution they almost exclusively use Opdivo in the lung setting.  He stated this was due to a strong rHe elationship with BMS, stressed his institutions clinical trial experience.  Stated they are using pembro in first line but there have not been many off study appropriate patients thus far.  He did not feel Nivo use has declined after ESMO or after Atezo approval.  Offered that they still do not have pembro on order sets.

He stated he has used single agent Nivo in SCLC but has yet to see a response.  He has recently switched to combo (he thought Nivo q2 and ipi 1 q 6 but was unsure)  Too early too judge.

On above he stated he has had no payer issues in SCLC using nivo or ipi/nivo

Thought that PDL-1 status was important in NSquamous, not in squamous

Stated he actually liked q2 over q3.  He stated most patients are local and it gives them a chance to monitor patients better.  He stated they are now dosing q2 for first 4 doses at institution.  After this patients go to central institution q 4 and go to a satellite institution with mostly NP for alternative dosing",15

Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.

?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.

o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC
o	In the context of a debate, she stated that PD1 agents should be the standard of care for initial therapy in SQ NSCLC specifically.
o	She expressed that with CM 026 specificially in SQ NSCLC, based upon the subgroup HR analysis, the PFS was still higher than in CM 017.  
o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.
o	She pointed to the much lower grade 3-4 AE?s seen with chemo compared to chemotherapy.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium and in conversation.
?	PDL1 testing is imperfect, but it helps to find patients who may respond.  Even if there is no expression, it doesn't mean the patient won't respond.
?	She says there is a JCO publication looking at pneumonitis with pd1, pdl1, and ctla4 therapies, showing this adverse event is agnostic to the type of CA, but it may be more frequently observed with CTLA4 therapy.
?	She emphasized that in KN 024, a high number of patients were screened to winnow down to the randomized population, around 15%.
o	She expressed that even with crossover of ~40% in the KN study, the OS looks good.
?	In the context of CM 026 being negative, she stated and understood that the trial was conducted very differently from KN 024, in terms of the primary endpoint and PDL1 cutoffs.
o	There are still lots of questions still to resolve, and lots to chew on.
?	It?s too soon to make a judgment about 1L data, but chemo will still have a role in 1L.
?	In conversation, she stated:
o	She admitted she hasn't had time to delve into CM 026 data yet since she was on call during the ESMO weekend.
o	She agreed to a subsequent meeting to discuss more in depth.
o	She thinks that the CM 026 negative result may have to do with study design itself.  
o	This is not the final answer on this question as there is still lots to learn about 1L therapy.
o	She believes that the future may be combination therapy (IO or chemo).",248

o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.

v.,Territory, N.CA,822.489795918,3.01944764589e-09,4,856,"The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","A regional Genitourinary AI provided the following insights from the podium at an Immuno-oncology CME event.

?	In regards to CM 025?
o	Survival curves do split early
o	In RCC, OS advantage regardless of PDL1 expression
o	PDL1 testing Not helpful and not necessary at this time
?	Talked about nivo/ipi 1L trial
?	Urothelial Carcinoma (Bladder)
o	Atezo approved, with companion diagnostic, but says he thinks doesn?t need to test (PDL1 Ventana)
?	PDL1 not mature yet
?	See responses, including CR, in IC0 (low expressers)
?	He has seen clinical benefit without radiologic response
?	More important to measure durability of response in pts who do respond, rather than focusing on medians (mOS), because lots of pts won?t respond, which drags this down.
o	Atezo, durva, nivo, in ph 1 trials, all better than historic 12% response rate of 1L chemo.
o	Variance of cutoffs for PDL1 in metastatic bladder cancer
?	CM 25 ORR was not affected by PDL1 (24% in favorable biomarker group, also 24% in all pts)
o	IMvigor 210 cohort 1
?	IC1 23% (6% CR), IC0 21% (8% CR); underscores that PDL1 status doesn?t matter
?	42% in upper tract pts, which is good since we don?t know what to do with these pts currently (Lack of treatment options).
?	First line platinum ineligible is vastly unmet need, will IMvigor lead to this FDA approval?
?	Prostate CA
o	Ipi post docetaxel trial failed to hit OS 
o	Pre-chemo Ipi pts trial also was negative",860

?	Reactively shared that the NCCN panel will include an immunotherapy update to the guideline to include both nivo and pembro.
?	Stated that her recommendation does distinguish that the data supporting nivo (Phase III) vs pembro (single arm trial) are different and should have a different category of recommendation.

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
?	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy.","?	Attendees: Michael Turner (MSL) and Tony Wang (HSL)

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC
o	In the context of a debate, she stated that PD1 agents should be the standard of care for initial therapy in SQ NSCLC specifically.
o	She expressed that with CM 026 specificially in SQ NSCLC, based upon the subgroup HR analysis, the PFS was still higher than in CM 017.  
o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.

?	PDL1 testing is imperfect, but it helps to find patients who may respond.  Even if there is no expression, it doesn't mean the patient won't respond.
?	She says there is a JCO publication looking at pneumonitis with pd1, pdl1, and ctla4 therapies, showing this adverse event is agnostic to the type of CA, but it may be more frequently observed with CTLA4 therapy.
?	She emphasized that in KN 024, a high number of patients were screened to winnow down to the randomized population, around 15%.
o	She expressed that even with crossover of ~40% in the KN study, the OS looks good.
?	In the context of CM 026 being negative, she stated and understood that the trial was conducted very differently from KN 024, in terms of the primary endpoint and PDL1 cutoffs.
o	There are still lots of questions still to resolve, and lots to chew on.
?	It?s too soon to make a judgment about 1L data, but chemo will still have a role in 1L.
?	In conversation, she stated:
o	She admitted she hasn't had time to delve into CM 026 data yet since she was on call during the ESMO weekend.
o	She agreed to a subsequent meeting to discuss more in depth.
o	She thinks that the CM 026 negative result may have to do with study design itself.  
o	This is not the final answer on this question as there is still lots to learn about 1L therapy.
o	She believes that the future may be combination therapy (IO or chemo).",283

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.

o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.

?	He reitereated that we don't know the significance of Biomarker testing PDL1 yet in melanoma and genitourinary cancers.","Met with a national lung AI/TL radiation oncologist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.",113

?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.
o	He referenced the above discussed imbalances in patient population and the lack of stratification of subgroups as possible explanations of the negative result, along with possibly bad luck.
o	He said that we need to hold off judgment until the combo data is available.",223

In their institution-specific pathway, they are already using pembrolizumab as their preferred agent for PD-L1 positive patients, with a cutoff of PD-L1>1%.  Upon being challenged by the HSL for the rationale for this low cut off for pembrolizumab in second line, he pointed to Keynote 10 data where patients with PD-L1>1% did better than docetaxel.

major academic,Territory, NH,110.102189781,1.10831070021e-05,43,880,"A key NCCN panelist for SCCHN a major academic hospital in New England was profiled to understand the treatment landscape in SCCHN.  This panelist was an investigator in CheckMate 141, and therefore was intimately familiar with the data presented at AACR.  The panelist considers the efficacy in OS to be better than what is seen in clinical practice with single agent therapies (methotrexate, cetuximab, docetaxel etc.).  He has a very negative opinion on the efficacy and toxicity of these standard of care therapies.  

Combination therapies will enhance the potential of immune-oncology in difficult to treat cancers and advanced stage disease.  Robust data needs to be developed for all options with Opdivo such as IO combinations, IO + targeted therapies and IO + chemotherapy/RT.  He also stressed the need to do clinical trials in nasopharyngeal SCCHN due to its unique etiology and response to treatment.  He does not endorse extending the NCCN recommendations to include this population based on data from other types of SCCHN.","The Director of Hematologic Malignancies at a major academic hospital in Boston downplayed the incidence of GVHD in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation after receiving nivolumab previously.  Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced disease in later lines of treatment are more susceptible to GVHD after allogeneic SCT generally, even without previous exposure to nivolumab.  As careful management of GVHD can reduce allo-associated mortality, nivolumab provides a good therapeutic option in advanced HL patients.","The NCCN Guidelines panelist (ophthalmology/medical oncology) for melanoma from a major New England academic hospital summarized the treatment algorithm for uveal melanoma, during a meeting with the HSLs.  In this institution, ocular brachytherapy is the treatment of choice for primary disease limited to the eye.  Proton beam is not used in this center.  He lamented the lack of options for patients once the disease progresses with metastasis primarily to the liver.  Systemic chemotherapy and targeted agents have produce very low response rates and does little to improve overall survival in these patients.  Hence, the preferred option for advanced uveal melanoma is enrolment in a clinical trial with IO agents.  According to him, immuno-oncology therapies, particularly the ipilimumab/nivolumab combination are the most significant advances in treating uveal melanoma in recent years, though their response rates are likely to be lower than what seen in cutaneous melanoma.",923

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:

-Believes that the term ?value? is currently more of a talking point than something actionable. However, in light of -024 and -026, he sees ?value? as defining a population and not just giving expensive drugs to every patient that walks through the door.
-Also believes ORR is crucial and may even be the most important of endpoints to any conversation around value
-PD-L1 testing is as big a change as there has been in a long time when it comes to directing decision-making in oncology.

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms

    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:

He honestly believes that a mistake happened and it would be worth the investment for the company and for patients.,"During a recent meeting with a lung cancer AI, the topic of PD-1 inhibitors in 1L was addressed in the context of CM-026 and KN-024. 
This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.","After fulfilling a request by the Director of Pharmacy Operations (DPO) for a large community oncology practice (that is the largest prescriber of Opdivo in the US) to review the lung, H&N, and RCC data presented by BMS at ASCO, the DPO provided several suggestions and requests: 
?  This DPO has met with several executive members of the BMS team, and was aware that we?re exploring flat dosing as well as single vial fixed combinations of Nivo + Ipi. Upon review of the SCLC (CA-032) and NSCLC (CA-012) data, this DPO mentioned that the different ratios of Nivo to Ipi may get confusing and could lead to mistakes. The practice?s EMR will be able to keep the doses organized, but the DPO fears that errors could be committed in the pharmacy during preparation.
    o  The DPO suggested that BMS consider color-coded labels to differentiate and provide an additional layer of protection against these types of errors. For example, Nivo 3 + Ipi 1 may have a blue label, whereas Nivo 1 + Ipi 3 could have a red label, and Nivo mono could be yellow.",19

-in addition, other qualitative metrics will be put in place and are compiled from OCM, CMS, QOPI, COA, ASCO, among others.

?	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS? stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she?s heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She?s unsure how they will get paid. She agreed with BMS request to not be in the guidelines as their institution and BMS align in their EBM thinking.

It looks like the chemo will ?hurt? the tumor, so there are more APC?s presented and then PD1 inhibitor?s efficacy could be enhanced.

Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial

The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:

There was unanimous agreement that the results of KN-024 have opened the doors on PD-L1 testing in 1L, and that future treatment/ management of NSCLC will be driven almost exclusively by biomarkers and genetic testing. 
There was emphasis on choosing the right assay for PD-L1 testing with the notion that the BMS biomarker assay is not as strong as Merck?s.","During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from a NTL/ NCCN panelist (medical oncologist) at an NCI-designated cancer center in NYC
-Believes that the term ?value? is currently more of a talking point than something actionable. However, in light of -024 and -026, he sees ?value? as defining a population and not just giving expensive drugs to every patient that walks through the door.
-Also believes ORR is crucial and may even be the most important of endpoints to any conversation around value
-PD-L1 testing is as big a change as there has been in a long time when it comes to directing decision-making in oncology. If pathologists aren?t testing regularly for PD-L1, it is the duty of the medical oncologists to speak with their pathologists to better educate them (because pathologists aren?t reading the most recent oncology literature).
-However, this panelist said that he wouldn?t necessarily send a patient back in for a biopsy if not enough tissue was available or testing was indeterminate in 1L setting.","During a recent meeting with a lung cancer AI, the topic of PD-1 inhibitors in 1L was addressed in the context of CM-026 and KN-024. 
This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.",4

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo.

I-O shift to first line:

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo.

This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.",132

NYC",632.28125,1.11648915739e-05,5,0,"During a Best of ASCO post-Melanoma talk, a discussion with 3 AIs/ RTLs (one is likely a future NCCN panelist) yielded insights about discontinuation of Nivo +/- Ipi in melanoma: 
-All 3 agreed that BMS needs real data on when it's safe to discontinue the Regimen in patients that respond.
-All 3 point to how much benefit patients derive from the Regimen after they discontinue due to AEs as proof that this treatment isn't needed indefinitely.
-One AI said that he would treat a patient for 2 years after achieving a CR and then discontinue, while a second AI said that he would treat for 3 years after achieving a CR and then discontinue.
-The AI (and likely future NCCN panelist) that would treat for 2 years after achieving a CR then discontinue mentioned that Nivo maintenance indefinitely isn't just inconvenient for a patient, but also financially toxic and an unnecessary burden on the system.","Heather Copher-Sweeney and I recently met with a NTL/ Lymphoma NCCN panelist from an NCI-designated academic institution to discuss the role of I-O in the treatment of cHL. The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from 5 NCCN panelists or NTLs regarding the evolving NSCLC management landscape, with particular focus on KN-024, CM-026, and PD-L1 testing.
KN-024:
The biggest discrepancy among the AI/ TLs was in the % of patients that KN-024 addresses:
-AI/ TL #1: 30-35%
-AI/ TL #2: closer to 20% (after excluding EGFR and ALK patients) ? just slightly more than the percentage of patients with EGFR mutation
-Remainder thought the number was between 25-30%
Rescanning:
-AI/ TL#3: Q6W for Pembro in 1L (~ to chemo rescanning)
-AI/ TL #2: Q9W for Pembro in 1L, then begin to decrease frequency
KN-021:
-AI/ TL #4: doesn?t believe that this will be adopted. There doesn?t seem to be an OS benefit, so why would PFS benefit matter
-AI/ TL #1: unconvinced that Pembro + chemo provides any tangible additional benefit",5

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC
o	In the context of a debate, she stated that PD1 agents should be the standard of care for initial therapy in SQ NSCLC specifically.
o	She expressed that with CM 026 specificially in SQ NSCLC, based upon the subgroup HR analysis, the PFS was still higher than in CM 017.  
o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.
o	She pointed to the much lower grade 3-4 AE?s seen with chemo compared to chemotherapy.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium and in conversation.
?	PDL1 testing is imperfect, but it helps to find patients who may respond.  Even if there is no expression, it doesn't mean the patient won't respond.
?	She says there is a JCO publication looking at pneumonitis with pd1, pdl1, and ctla4 therapies, showing this adverse event is agnostic to the type of CA, but it may be more frequently observed with CTLA4 therapy.
?	She emphasized that in KN 024, a high number of patients were screened to winnow down to the randomized population, around 15%.
o	She expressed that even with crossover of ~40% in the KN study, the OS looks good.
?	In the context of CM 026 being negative, she stated and understood that the trial was conducted very differently from KN 024, in terms of the primary endpoint and PDL1 cutoffs.
o	There are still lots of questions still to resolve, and lots to chew on.
?	It?s too soon to make a judgment about 1L data, but chemo will still have a role in 1L.
?	In conversation, she stated:
o	She admitted she hasn't had time to delve into CM 026 data yet since she was on call during the ESMO weekend.
o	She agreed to a subsequent meeting to discuss more in depth.
o	She thinks that the CM 026 negative result may have to do with study design itself.  
o	This is not the final answer on this question as there is still lots to learn about 1L therapy.
o	She believes that the future may be combination therapy (IO or chemo).",248

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.
?	He mentioned that the NCCN NSCLC panel has been busy with recent updates with Pembro and consideration of Atezo data, with emails flying around the group.","Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).

?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.",6

o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.

?	PDL1 testing is imperfect, but it helps to find patients who may respond.  Even if there is no expression, it doesn't mean the patient won't respond.
?	She says there is a JCO publication looking at pneumonitis with pd1, pdl1, and ctla4 therapies, showing this adverse event is agnostic to the type of CA, but it may be more frequently observed with CTLA4 therapy.
?	She emphasized that in KN 024, a high number of patients were screened to winnow down to the randomized population, around 15%.
o	She expressed that even with crossover of ~40% in the KN study, the OS looks good.
?	In the context of CM 026 being negative, she stated and understood that the trial was conducted very differently from KN 024, in terms of the primary endpoint and PDL1 cutoffs.
o	There are still lots of questions still to resolve, and lots to chew on.
?	It?s too soon to make a judgment about 1L data, but chemo will still have a role in 1L.
?	In conversation, she stated:
o	She admitted she hasn't had time to delve into CM 026 data yet since she was on call during the ESMO weekend.
o	She agreed to a subsequent meeting to discuss more in depth.
o	She thinks that the CM 026 negative result may have to do with study design itself.

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.
o	He referenced the above discussed imbalances in patient population and the lack of stratification of subgroups as possible explanations of the negative result, along with possibly bad luck.
o	He said that we need to hold off judgment until the combo data is available.",233

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a regional melanoma AI at a high volume regional institution, who leads his institution?s lab and works collaboratively with melanoma medical oncologists at his institution, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

TLs,Territory, NV,43.3213773314,2.07592297183e-25,102,1508,"Post 026 release:
- 2 NTL and 2 RTL mentioned that had BMS selected a different PDL-1 cut-off the 026 trial may have been positive, perception is NOT that nivo is less effective than pembro from the 026 read-out
-  2 RTLs have stated that PFS may not have been the best endpoint and are waiting for OS readout
-  1 community TL and 2 academic TLs stated that they currently have patients who are asking for 1L monotherapy pembro based on the 024 press release, some patients are willing to pay out of pocket for treatment vs enrolling in clinical trials
-  1 RTL was less optimistic stating ?you shot yourselves in the foot by selecting a 5% cut-point and endpoint of PFS?.  Combo therapy (ipi+nivo) will have to demonstrate ?cure? or high % of CR to compete against monotherapy pembro in + expressers based on a more favorable toxicity profile
-  Consensus from academic to community TLs stating that they see pem and nivo as being the same and the Q3week is the key advantage that pembro has despite the differences in trial design because they now have a better understanding of MOA, activity, and safety in a collection of trials across nivo and pembro","Local lung TL stated that in the 2L - nivo, pembro, atezeo are similar in his opinion in efficacy and does not see a difference in safety between pdl-1s and pd1s.  Less frequent dosing is more favorable but he does have a few patients who would rather be seen more often, and nivo in this case becomes the preferred choice out over the other two agents.",Academic TL mentioned the community lung TLs are testing for PDL-1 because they believe pembro is more effective in PDL1+ patients.  He said that because we do not need to test there seems to be a perceived absence of benefit in the positive expressers.  He stated that when he shared with the community TLs BMS's data in the PDL1 >5% and >10% they were very surprised and frustrated to why they have not heard of the data but will likely switch to nivo.,1610
3 mg/kg,Territory, NV,42.2899159664,5.80287078754e-06,19,1349,Discussed with over multiple community and academic TLs regarding the 240 mg flat dose.  Many do see the value of flat dosing in oncology and asked if BMS will have a 240 mg vial and still keep the current 10 mg and 4 mg vials for weight based therapies (regimen).  All are giving their patients at the moment the 3 mg/kg dosing who's total dose falls below 240 mg.  The rationale for some correlates to cost being different for a 240 mg flat dose vs a 150 mg dose in a 50 kg patient and others were concerned about increased toxicities but were comfortable after reactively presenting the data on safety between flat vs weight based dosing.,"Local HN TL commented how confusing the dosing landscape is for the PD-1 agents, with weight-based dosing vs flat dosing and when to use which.  He ended up prescribing 240 mg flat dose for nivo in H&N assuming flat dose was across all solid tumors similar to the flat dose for pembro.  Made TL aware of the data available currently with nivo on flat dose and TL switched to wt-base dosing for the HN patient.",2 pharmacists mentioned that their institution will be using the 3 mg/kg nivo dose in patients <80kg and the fixed dose capping at 240 mg for heavier patients.,1368

When asked how he viewed the PD-1/PDL-1 agents, he mentioned there's certainly a difference with Roche's compound and said that with the q3wk dosing and additional benefit observed in subset of patients, strong likelihood of physicians adopting atezo in the 2L especially with an all-comers population.  He repeated again that while the % of pneumonitis was low in OAK that did not impress him as much compared to the data surrounding patients with brain mets.","Melanoma RTL at an academic institution has mentioned that Merck has been very accommodating and he seems to get all ISRs approved through Merck.  This is consistent to the message at SWOG this year highlighting that there's an abundance from industry and if you are not funded by one organization, likelihood of being funded by another is high.","RTL who was an author on a recent pembro publication brought up that he did not see a difference with pembro 2mg vs 10mg in NSCLC based on a modeling analysis looking at exposure over time.  This is consistent with what Merck had highlighted at several ad boards but did not feel this would change his use of Opdivo for lung in 2L.

Did not feel they would see too many patients who express >50% and feel that PDL-1 not the best biomarker and commented to FISH testing and EGFR back in the days.,Community TL commented that in 2L RCC he treats his patients with nivo but does not feel the need to test for PDL-1 as patients benefit regardless unlike patients treated in lung with PD1 agents.,Academic TL mentioned the community lung TLs are testing for PDL-1 because they believe pembro is more effective in PDL1+ patients.

no issues,Territory, NV,37.5910364146,8.675934829e-06,21,255,Academic TL stated that he would not omit bleomycin in the first couple of cycles of ABVD for newly diagnosed HL patients as the cure rate drops 8% if it is totally omitted during this time.  He would only do it if patients are over the age of 60 to prevent potential fatal toxicity.,Regional academic TL who specializes in pediatrics offered information that she has utilized Nivolumab in 5 adolescent pediatric patients who had R/R cHL who had failed auto transplant.  She said that they have seen good results in all patients.  They have had no issues with getting insurance to cover it for any of them by using the NEJM article.,SCCHN RTL in academic practice has been using nivo in 2L for his SCCHN patients and has seen positive response in his patients and has not had issues with reimbursement.,276

RTL also feels that while EXTREME is standard of care it's unfortunate to see 1L studies using the regimen as a comparator arm as patients often discontinue due to severe toxicity.",Several local lung TLs are not clear if there are differences in the toxicities profiles between the PD-1s vs PD-L1 as they've seen both hyperglycemia and myocarditis in both nivo and pembro and more recently use of atezo leading to hyperglycemia in some of their patients including myocarditis.,"Hospital pharmacist and BMS RCC speaker stated she was disappointed to see that CM 026 data in patients with >50% PDL-1 expression did not demonstrate statistical or clinically meaningful results.  However, after discussing the 026 study design and characteristics between the nivo vs chemo arm she felt data can be skewed sometimes by even a few patients if not stratified (i.e. the 1.5 difference in >50% PDL-1 expressors).

TL told,Territory, NYC - ST1,337.433333333,4.16614430146e-05,65,1364,A TL told me he has successfully used Nivo in several patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and has recently begun to use it in patients with active Hepatitis virus infections.  He added he has not seen any significant drop in viral titers unless he gave concomitant anti-viral therapy.  In those cases he noted no issues with the combination of drugs in terms of tolerability.,A TL told me that has used Opdivo in the treatment of several patients with cholangiocarcinoma of the liver and achieved several Partial Responses and a few stable disease.  The patients all tolerated the treatment very well to date,"A GI RTL told me his site has been approached to participate in Keynote-224, a trial for Pembrolizumab in 2nd line HCC.  This trial is a single arm phase 2 trial.  Of potential interest is the TL remarked ""Merck is really pushing our site to open as soon possible""  
This site is not participating in any BMS trials but two sites are located nearby.  Seems unlikely patients that progress on the Sorafenib arm of the the-459 trial will switch institutions but its possible this trial may impact the OS endpoint of -459",1429

Prefers DDMVAC for MIBC neo-adjuvant based on 8710 SWOG (2001, University Penn, 317 pts.  1/2 received no neo-adjuvant   Results: 5 yr overall survival was 57% vs 42% favoring the MVAC arm
Patients with a pathologic complete response had an overall survival of 85% at 5 years)

Stated best option for second line systemic is clinical trial.  Has used atezo a few times.  Too early to tell.  Otherwise uses Pem.  Feels taxol is useless

From a guideline standpoint feels FDA approval is important.  Will accept published data but if only a presentation this would mean little unless the results were shockingly good

Believes q3 beats q2","I met with NCCN panelist for SCLC (though sees mostly NSCLC) at an NCCN center in  midwest.  She offered these insights:

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

On the design of 026 she felt that BMS probably had good advice given to us at ad boards when designing trial but we did not listen (she did not expand on this)

She stated that her institution just started testing for PDL-1 in house.  Prior it took 2-3 weeks for results.  Now takes 2 days",371
Academic TL,Territory, OH,31.0326443886,1.2784836001e-09,66,1696,"Academic TL commented that the results from KN-024 will be practice changing. He was excited to hear that pembro was superior for both PFS and OS. He is awaiting the data, but stated that he would follow the -024 design and use pembro 1L only in patients with >50% PD-L1 expression. His use of PD-1 inhibitors 1L will be data driven; does not plan to utilize haphazardly.","Academic TL commented from the podium that the ORR of I-O in H&N are somewhat discouraging.

HN,Territory, OH,30.0628742515,1.91987562839e-06,24,0,Met with NTL in HN.  Stated now that we have HN approval we clearly should be the market leader given out larger phase 3 trial with OS.  Stated everyone at his institution would use Nivo after Pt in HN,"I met with NCCN panelist for HN and two other MDs at his hospital
They feel right now PD1 inhibitors are standard second line HN.  This is their SOC and they have not had any pushback (have not needed a single appeal) from any payer at their institution.  They consider Nivo and Pembro equivalent.",RTL in SCCHN noted at his center (Major university in midwest) they were using mostly pembro off trial for HN cancer because it has been approved longer and his center feels access is easier.  This contrasts with another major center in same city who has been using nivo all yr without any insurance issues.,24
Q2,Territory, OH,30.0628742515,1.91987562839e-06,24,256,"Local TL, following an SIV for a dose-optimzation trial inquired as to why, given the half-life of nivolumab we hadn't use a Q4 or Q3 dosing strategy in the first place. He followed up his own question with a guess that it was likely due to lower sticker shock for a per dose cost being far less at Q2 than it would have been Q4 following initial approval.","When addressing the question of how he currently differentiates pembro and nivo in NSCLC at this point, given all the recent news, a regional TL commented that it essentially all boils down to convenience in his opinion (q2 vs q3 dosing) and that efficacy based on PDL1 is simply a non-factor; that it's all about trial design differences and that both products would likely display very similar data if compared in a head-to-head, ""apples to apples"" fashion.","I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab",280

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

This NTL, who is an investigator on several studies with IO+IO combinations, voiced opinion (based on her experience) that Ipi+Nivo seems to be the only IO+IO combo that can resurrect a response in patients who have failed PD1 monotherapy.  4-1BB, anti-KIR, OX40 etc do not seem to have this activity.

major academic,Territory, RI,110.102189781,1.10831070021e-05,43,880,"A key NCCN panelist for SCCHN a major academic hospital in New England was profiled to understand the treatment landscape in SCCHN.  This panelist was an investigator in CheckMate 141, and therefore was intimately familiar with the data presented at AACR.  The panelist considers the efficacy in OS to be better than what is seen in clinical practice with single agent therapies (methotrexate, cetuximab, docetaxel etc.).  He has a very negative opinion on the efficacy and toxicity of these standard of care therapies.  

Combination therapies will enhance the potential of immune-oncology in difficult to treat cancers and advanced stage disease.  Robust data needs to be developed for all options with Opdivo such as IO combinations, IO + targeted therapies and IO + chemotherapy/RT.  He also stressed the need to do clinical trials in nasopharyngeal SCCHN due to its unique etiology and response to treatment.  He does not endorse extending the NCCN recommendations to include this population based on data from other types of SCCHN.","The Director of Hematologic Malignancies at a major academic hospital in Boston downplayed the incidence of GVHD in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation after receiving nivolumab previously.  Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced disease in later lines of treatment are more susceptible to GVHD after allogeneic SCT generally, even without previous exposure to nivolumab.  As careful management of GVHD can reduce allo-associated mortality, nivolumab provides a good therapeutic option in advanced HL patients.","The NCCN Guidelines panelist (ophthalmology/medical oncology) for melanoma from a major New England academic hospital summarized the treatment algorithm for uveal melanoma, during a meeting with the HSLs.  In this institution, ocular brachytherapy is the treatment of choice for primary disease limited to the eye.  Proton beam is not used in this center.  He lamented the lack of options for patients once the disease progresses with metastasis primarily to the liver.  Systemic chemotherapy and targeted agents have produce very low response rates and does little to improve overall survival in these patients.  Hence, the preferred option for advanced uveal melanoma is enrolment in a clinical trial with IO agents.  According to him, immuno-oncology therapies, particularly the ipilimumab/nivolumab combination are the most significant advances in treating uveal melanoma in recent years, though their response rates are likely to be lower than what seen in cutaneous melanoma.",923

She would like to see the field come up with a consensus guideline to identify pseudo-progression.,"NTL said he has not treated a single patient with immunotherapy who experienced pseudo-progression. However, he has treated around 10 patients (out of 80+ total) with immunotherapy who have had ""mixed"" responses where some tumors demonstrate response and others do not. He contrasted this with prior 30 years of treatment experience where he never saw a ""mixed"" response. The NTL thinks the field needs to make more of an effort to understand this phenomenon.",Academic NTL on NCCN panel shared that one of the biggest concerns in lung treatment is how long to treat. We discussed the 153 trial design but she shared that issue is really community oncologists who don?t fully understand pseudo-progression and that they will keep treating patients unnecessarily with PD-1 inhibitors rather than switching. She was not aware of the data sets from 017 and 057 on patients who were treated through progression. She further shared that she felt that the field needed a definition and understanding of pseudo-progression to help identify patients who may benefit.,359

He shared that he feels that there is a need to understand sequencing of PD-1 agents and did not agree that all PD-1 agents are the same and that understanding the epitope to which the antibodies bind would be important in determining whether there would be an interest in using pembro then nivo sequentially. He also shared that he has been re-challenging with nivo by trying to elicit a response using chemotherapy.

Has given several patients a short course of pazaponib until 'any first toxicity' as a pass-through to fulfill insurance requirements per PI.","GU RTL shared some factors he considers when deciding between nivo (~70% of pts) and TKI (now cabo, ~30% of pts) for 2L RCC trx:
- pace of progression (20% of pts exhibiting faster progression prefers TKI) 
- toxicity of 1L VEGF TKI (if had minimal tox/dose reduction, more likely to give cabo 2L due to convience of oral dosing)
- compliance to taking oral meds and reporting of side effects
- Performance status (lower PS would always get nivo)","RTL stated that as more data has come out pan tumor, he has decided that 'psudoprogression is a extremely rare occurrence and not something that 'any longer plays into his decisions making'.

Stated that he was 'so hopeful' around IO, but that it has been largely dampened due to the ""very modest"" data from nivo (143) and pembro (KN028).   He hopes that possibly 1L treatment will produce stronger results.","NTL in lung stated that at this point, and ""maybe it will change if the numbers for KN-024 are actually much better than I think they will be"" he sees his use of pembro (or any aPD-1 monotherapy) in the first line to be very limited. He expects that the magnitude of benefit may be somewhat modest. ""significant doesn't always mean incredibly meaningful""  

He's states that either in 1L for trials, or in 2L, that he has seen such a ""tiny, maybe 15%"" of patients with >50% PDL1.  ""Whatever the trials data says for proportion of the population, I figure my experience is half of that it almost makes me questioning if I should bother holding up starting chemo for such a tiny fraction"".","RTL shared that in his ~8 RCC patients (a few started off-label prior to approval and out ~5 months) he has not seen any response that would have qualified as RECIST responders, however nearly all have stabilized disease or modest shrinkage and are feeling markedly better.  States that he is perfectly comfortable with this and similar to many agents in GU landscape.  States that unless patients are feeling worse or have other 'triggers', he is starting to scan no earlier than 12-16 weeks as he would not discontinue drug based on that scan anyway.",9

In addition to clear efficacy, he stated the fact that 032 showed that the toxicity profile was more blunted than the I3+N1 dose in melanoma and NSCLC was the 'final supporting straw'.

TL (note, not investigator on either 141 or 651) appreciated 'dealers choice' option in 141 and think that trial was well designed to reflect all standard practices.

TL believes that 'all patients are going to see all the different chemo agents and cetuximab at some point' but believes that sequential therapy is better for tox/QOL rather than getting them all at one time","RTL thinks that ipi+nivo for 1L will be 'practice changing' if it holds up in phase 3.  Given the enrichment in both nivo mono and ipi+nivo increasing with extent of PDL1 staining, his concern is what the cutoff will be defined as to get maximal benefit and how many patients will it will be an option for.  
He is very impressed by the nivo or pembo + Plat doublet studies and wishes that these studies were further along towards registration as he thinks that this will be the 'most widespread and easiest uptake option' (""always easier to add another agent to SOC rather than change the whole SOC"")",4

Things are very different in the 1L setting ? results from a phase III RCT are typically required to displace or compete with a SOC that has been validated in phase III RCTs. The NCCN panel for lung received some flack in the past for having prematurely given a broad recommendation for Tarceva in the 1L, and then having to back track. Now everybody is more cautious.","A regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory indicated that medical oncologists for lung at this institution try to test all patients for PD-L1 expression at diagnosis, but they do so more to increase their understanding of when/how PD-L1 inhibitors work than to make 2L treatment decisions. ?But it is a fight: pathologists constantly push back against PD-L1 testing, though typically not for the right reasons? (because testing for PD-L1 expression erodes their benefit as they receive a set fee to test tumor biopsies for biomarkers and all biopsies are tested for EGFR and ALK abnormalities).","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",2232

Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",640

?	Based on personal experience, does not see anything out of ordinary in Merryman?s study on safety of allo-SCT after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Reduced-intensity conditioning therapy severely depletes lymphocyte populations; therefore prior-nivo therapy is unlikely to be a major contributor to development of severe GVHD compared to well-established risk factors (e.g., degree of HAL disparity, total body irradiation). Even sees a potential indication for post-allo-SCT nivo maintenance therapy to boost immune system and reduce risk of HL relapse.","An academic RAI and Bone Marrow Transplant Director shared the following unsolicited insights while discussing his clinical practice and the HL treatment landscape:
?	Nivo is an exciting new treatment option as a bridge to allo-SCT for eligible patients who progress after auto-SCT (did not mention BV).

In these patients, would administer nivo for a short duration, and not to progression, because views reduced-intensity conditioning therapy followed by allo-SCT as the SOC.","An academic RAI and Bone Marrow Transplant Director shared the following unsolicited insights while discussing his clinical practice and the HL treatment landscape:

?Major changes are on the horizon for the treatment of HL. Immunotherapy is the future for patients with HD. There currently are many trials with multiple anti-PD-1 agents, in combination with many other agents, and in various lines of treatment, including 1L. None of the published studies is an RCT. Anti-PD-1 agents work, but I can?t tell you how to use them. Patients who fail standard therapies should receive pembro or nivo until progression or unacceptable toxicity. It is difficult to say anything about the relative efficacy/safety profiles of pembro vs. nivo. Controversies are emerging regarding the role of transplantation in this new context?.",713

Things are very different in the 1L setting ? results from a phase III RCT are typically required to displace or compete with a SOC that has been validated in phase III RCTs. The NCCN panel for lung received some flack in the past for having prematurely given a broad recommendation for Tarceva in the 1L, and then having to back track. Now everybody is more cautious.","A regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory indicated that medical oncologists for lung at this institution try to test all patients for PD-L1 expression at diagnosis, but they do so more to increase their understanding of when/how PD-L1 inhibitors work than to make 2L treatment decisions. ?But it is a fight: pathologists constantly push back against PD-L1 testing, though typically not for the right reasons? (because testing for PD-L1 expression erodes their benefit as they receive a set fee to test tumor biopsies for biomarkers and all biopsies are tested for EGFR and ALK abnormalities).","NCCN panel dynamics and PD-L1 testing in the guidelines (reactive comments from a regional access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory):
?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.  
The AI finished by saying that, based on the data of Checkmate 012 he had just seen, it should become harder and harder to elude the question.",2232

The majority of the patients continue IO therapy with intense management of ocular adverse events.  But in the most extreme cases, adverse reactions can progress from perfect vision to complete non-responsiveness to light within 48 hours.  Factors that increase the risk of ocular AEs are currently unknown.  

Less serious AEs are managed with topical corticosteroids, while serious AEs warrant withholding IO therapy and treating with IV corticosteroids, particularly when the optic nerve is involved.  Cyclosporine and artificial tears are used to manage dry eyes associated with IO agents.  As the AEs can worsen very quickly, both ophthalmologists and medical oncologists should identify and treat them without delay, as well as educate patients proactively on the symptoms.  This NCCN panelist also stressed the need to train community and academic oncologists as well as ophthalmologists to identify the symptoms of ocular IMARs, given the propensity of these AEs to worsen very quickly.",779

""Newly-approved immunotherapy drugs for cancer have contributed to growing revenue at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as more patients visit the hospital for access to the life-saving treatments.

""The hospital?s net patient service revenue skyrocketed in the second quarter, according to financials released last week. For the first two quarters ending March 31, the hospital reported net patient service revenue of $441.4 million, a 23 percent increase from the two quarters the year prior.

""Hospital spokesman John Noble said the uptick is mainly because of two new immunotherapy drugs approved by the FDA toward the end of 2015 ? one for the treatment of lung and renal cell cancer called Opdivo, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and one, called Keytruda and sold by Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) for the treatment of melanoma...""

""The hospital also saw an increase in volume, which contributed to higher patient revenue. According to financials, the hospital saw a 3,216 patient uptick in infusion visits to 76,647, and a 2,634 patient uptick to 38,201 clinic visits...""

""Though the patient revenue contributed to a 17 percent increase in operating revenue to $682.4 million, the high cost of the pharmacy drugs contributed to an uptick in expenses, with operating expenses increasing 17 percent to $655 million.

""The hospital still reported impressive year-over-year gains in operating income, seeing a 20 percent increase to $27.3 million compared to the same period the year prior.""","Large PBM quote:

In a previous meeting, The Director of Pharmacy Laura Casanova and the Oncology Pharmacist Mark Hagen stated they were going to contact each Pharmaceutical company and request they supply a contract to compensate for their lack of pricing for the 340-b orphan drugs.

I  followed-up with the account and reinforced the BMS policy as it relates to ?newly eligible? 340-b entities and orphan drugs.  I then shifted the conversation away from cost and moved into value of our medicines, patient assistance program and our reimbursement support. 

Mark Hagen did not mention Merck or anything they might be offering to address this situation.  The conversation moved away from what he addressed in our last discussion of restricting one agent over another based on contract offering.  I believe Mark realized he needs to move his energy away from restricting these important drugs and focus on other ways to address the 340-b issue.   He said he is going to check into other wholesalers for potential better contracts for specialty drugs, look into getting his class of trade status changed, and potentially setting up his purchasing into in-patient and out-patient outlets to potentially move away from in-patient bundle payments from Medicaid/Medicare where he feels he is losing money.",358

Additionally, when looking to prefer products, Price Protection is becoming an increasingly important feature of rebate contracts. For example, if I have price protection for Xarelto and Pradaxa, but not Eliquis, clients may be inclined to select your competitors because of the predictable nature of the spend.

produce,Territory, VT,50.6893939394,4.04567003376e-06,12,0,"A leading expert of immuno-oncology and immune checkpoint inhibition highlighted the differences between CTLA-4 inhibition and PD-1 inhibition at the Evergrande Symposium in Boston.  As CTLA-4 pathway acts at the priming level, an earlier step in mounting an immune response, he expects a better long term immune-memory with anti-CTLA-4 agents.  This is likely to lead to a higher long-term survival with ipiliumumab than nivolumab.  Nivolumab acts in the periphery and relieves the inhibition mechanisms are a much later stage of immune activation, and thus will produce less impressive long-term survival.","A leading academic thought leader discussed the clinical trial results of cabozantinib and his own personal experience in using this agent.  Toxicity and adverse events remains the major concern with cabozantinib.  Though cabozantinib produced very good results in clinical trials, he is cautious about using this agent in his practice.  He has participated in nivolumab trials, and uses nivolumab frequently in his clinical practice.  However, he stressed that the TKIs will remain a staple part of therapy of RCC, and the right patient can derive significant benefit from them.","The NCCN Guidelines panelist (ophthalmology/medical oncology) for melanoma from a major New England academic hospital summarized the treatment algorithm for uveal melanoma, during a meeting with the HSLs.  In this institution, ocular brachytherapy is the treatment of choice for primary disease limited to the eye.  Proton beam is not used in this center.  He lamented the lack of options for patients once the disease progresses with metastasis primarily to the liver.  Systemic chemotherapy and targeted agents have produce very low response rates and does little to improve overall survival in these patients.  Hence, the preferred option for advanced uveal melanoma is enrolment in a clinical trial with IO agents.  According to him, immuno-oncology therapies, particularly the ipilimumab/nivolumab combination are the most significant advances in treating uveal melanoma in recent years, though their response rates are likely to be lower than what seen in cutaneous melanoma.",12

He feels that the less-than-impressive efficacy of pembrolizumab in squamous NSCLC is primarily a result of low number of patients.  He is waiting to see the results from KeyNote 024 and CheckMate 026 where larger populations of squamous and non-squamous populations are studied.  His institution uses the 22C3 pharmDx assay for PD-L1 IHC, but he sees no difference between 22C3 and 28-8 assays.  Responding to a question on how he chooses anti-PD-1 therapies in second line NSCLC, he revealed that most of his patients are low PD-L1 expressers and thus they receive nivolumab therapy.","A leading academic thought leader and clinical trials expert from a New England NCCN institution underplayed the significance of CheckMate 026 results disclosed so far.  He felt that PFS is not a good endpoint for IO therapies, as many IO trials have already shown positive response rates and overall survival despite a lack of PFS advantage.  In cancers with low T- lymphocyte infiltration, CTLA-4 inhibition using ipilimumab may enhance the efficacy of nivolumab by increasing infiltration.","Dipak Mistry (MSL) and Jai Puthenveettil (HSL) met with David McDermott, MD, a national thought leader in melanoma and RCC, to discuss the cost of Opdivo+Yervoy regimen in solid tumors in advance of his podium presentation at AACR.

We presented the cost analysis incorporating the median number of doses and the discontinuation data from CheckMate 067 and CheckMate 069 to educate him on the true cost of the regimen.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC

This is a No-Access site, so there is no opportunity for me to educate those physicians.
TL said that the data from Hodi's ASCO'16 poster from CM-069 will be helpful in educating colleagues that steroid used to treat irAE's don't diminish the tumor response to Ipi+Nivo Regimen.
However, TL said that similar data for Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC would be even more impactful. The perception of irAE's on Nivo are less severe than when on Regimen. So physicians may still want to shorten the steroid treatment on Nivo monotherapy, unless they're shown that there's no reason to do so.","NP at a community hospital reported continued ""difficulty convincing some of my doctor colleagues to initiate steroids appropriately"".

?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","A regional Genitourinary AI provided the following insights from the podium at an Immuno-oncology CME event.

?	In regards to CM 025?
o	Survival curves do split early
o	In RCC, OS advantage regardless of PDL1 expression
o	PDL1 testing Not helpful and not necessary at this time
?	Talked about nivo/ipi 1L trial
?	Urothelial Carcinoma (Bladder)
o	Atezo approved, with companion diagnostic, but says he thinks doesn?t need to test (PDL1 Ventana)
?	PDL1 not mature yet
?	See responses, including CR, in IC0 (low expressers)
?	He has seen clinical benefit without radiologic response
?	More important to measure durability of response in pts who do respond, rather than focusing on medians (mOS), because lots of pts won?t respond, which drags this down.
o	Atezo, durva, nivo, in ph 1 trials, all better than historic 12% response rate of 1L chemo.

She wanted to review CM141, stating her view that BMS;s data (Checkmate141) are ""much more robust "" than Merck's (KN-012 & KN-055).","Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.

She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.

?	Reactively shared that the NCCN panel will include an immunotherapy update to the guideline to include both nivo and pembro.

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
?	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy.","?	Attendees: Michael Turner (MSL) and Tony Wang (HSL)

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a regional melanoma AI at a high volume regional institution, who leads his institution?s lab and works collaboratively with melanoma medical oncologists at his institution, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

?	Centers of excellence would have the goal of becoming accredited as a cancer center of excellence in specific types of cancer, such as breast cancer, melanoma, lung, and liver as examples.

?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","Met with a regional state and Medicare CAC AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI thinks that combos of SBRT with PD1 immunotherapy may bring great responses due to release of antigens which primes the immune system.
?	He thinks such SBRT and PD1 combo regimens make sense, partly because it may increase the chance to observe an abscopal effect.
?	He inquired whether BMS is sponsoring such trials.  Reactively shared with him that MSKCC is doing a trial comparing SBRT plus Nivo versus Nivo monotherapy in head and neck cancer (available on clinicaltrials.gov)
?	He thinks these types of combos may increase the chance to see CR?s in patients, which should be the true goal of therapy.","Met with a regional general oncology AI/TL, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

?	AI believes that trials pairing immunotherapy with traditional chemotherapy makes no sense scientifically, since chemo destroys immune cells such as lymphocytes and immunotherapy is supposed to stimulate such immune cells. 
?	AI questioned the logic of Merck?s favoring of trials combining PD1 inhibitor with chemotherapy, for the above reason.  
?	He says it makes sense to treat with immunotherapy first and then chemo.  This is partly because immunotherapy stimulates immune response and then chemo destroys some of the inhibitory immune cells rather than activating ones, such as T-cells.",6

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a national lung AI/TL radiation oncologist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

o	The picture is murky
o	Because we see responses in some PDL1 negative pts, expression is not ?go or no go? factor in treatment
?	He says hopefully in the future we will have an algorithm to guide who to treat with monotherapy versus combo.

o	When patients get to second line, they are much worse PS and won?t be able to get chemo and IO becomes a much better option
o	They see very few EGFR and alk patients
o	They get the traditional heavy smoker and drinker
o	They haven?t been seeing many stage III lung patients, either get very early or very late patients

I-O/I-O combination is scary due to the unpredictable nature of IPI.  I/O/Chemo is a better strategy in 1L due to the level of comfort that clinicians have with Nivolumab and chemotherapeutic regimens.  The AI feels that this strategy is better suited for success.  Additionally, the AI felt that our strategy in 1L monotherapy was too broad.  Had our target expression level been similar to our competitor's, BMS would have been approved in 1L NSCLC.  Therefore, he views the checkpoint inhibitors as the same.","Met with NSCLC NCCN panelist:  the following insights were shared regarding 1L monotherapy.  Doesn't think that checkpoint inhibitors will be relevant without the personalization of medicine.  Targeted therapy options are more personlized for the patient in the 1L setting.  Checkpoint inhibitors and targeted chemo may provide a better option.  The Regimen data was promising, but a lot more efficacy and safety trials, more robust, need to be conducted.  There is definite value in Regimen, but more conclusive studies need to be conducted.","Spoke with a key advisor to a melanoma NCCN panelist.  They have continued to use nivo monotherapy in 1L melanoma, but his thought process has recently changed.  He attended AACR and saw the OS data from 069, and spoke with Dr. Hodi about OS in patients that discontinue treatment and Dr. Freidman about AE management, he has come to a conclusion that Regimen is practice changing and has distinct benefits over monotherapy in both high and low expression.",634

He described patients who refuse chemotherapy and less than 50% positive as those who he might consider for 1L anti-pd1, however, said the limiting factor would be cost.","Regarding the use of I/O/chemo combination in 1L NSCLC, LTL commented that it's a silly argument to make that you wouldn't want to use this strategy since it would leave you with limited options in the 2L and beyond. He stated that if the data showed to be an improvement over anything else, there's no excuse not to use it and it's on the physician to figure out what to do next.

He followed up stating that he has a hard time believing the 2nd possibility based on what we?ve seen up to this point where these PD1 agents have performed in an extremely similar manner across many comparable studies.","Regarding the recent ESMO data overall, NTL commented that he?d finally just looked closely at all of the 024 data and was shocked to see how ?remarkably positive their efficacy was where you could clearly see separation of curves from the back of a room? and how ?remarkably negative 026 appeared to be in all of their endpoints?.","While discussing the outcomes of 026 with a regional lung TL, he acknowledged that while the efficacy appears to be the same as chemo and BMS would like to think we've won on toxicity, he argued that he wouldn't necessarily claim victory based on the G3/4 any treatment related AE differences. While he recognized the number was considerably lower for nivo, he commented that nivo tox can be overall more difficult to manage and potentially more severe than chemo related tox. Specifically, he noted that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (accounting for nearly 20% of G3/4 chemo tox) are both generally very easy to manage and aren't considered a big deal. Anemia (almost 20% of G3/4 for chemo) is a little tougher but still not as bad as potentially life-threatening pneumonitis or some of the other issues that PD1 therapy can bring on. Lung docs are very familiar and comfortable with chemo toxicities and even when falling into G3/4 levels of severity, heme-related tox isn't a big deal to them.",289

In many cases, this is the first experience some physicians have had with ipi and despite the dosing/schedule being adjusted, it comes with much more immune related side effects than nivo alone.
