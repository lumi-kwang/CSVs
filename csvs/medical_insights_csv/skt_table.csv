NTL1:  How do you sell a trial patient on a trial (NCT02788279), knowing that they could be placed on a study arm for Atezolizumab monotherapy? This is something that is understood to be a very expensive placebo in this setting.
NTL2: We don?t know that atezolizumab has no effect in this setting because our experience is limited and the alternatives, such as regorafenib, have a very low response rate.
NTL1:  This phase III was launched after a phase I with a response rate of less than 20% in a population of fewer than 50 patients.  It seems we are desperate for immunotherapy to work in every cancer.","At an international GI conference, three HCC NTLs had a brief discussion of PD1s:

NTL1:  We are all tempted to use pembrolizumab and jump on the bandwagon; Merck has made it very available through access support.  However, we need more data before using it when systemic therapies that have shown benefit are exhausted.
NTL2: We use PD1 inhibitors in patients that are MSI high.
NTL3: There may be rationale in MSI high patients for the use of PD1 inhibitors but data is still not conclusive and it is inappropriate to use without testing.","At an international GI conference, three NTLs had a discussion about immunotherapy in CRC:

NTL1:  Why is there a difference between single agent nivo and pembro in MSI high.  
NTL2:  Pembro study is a higher response rate but not a global study.  Both look to have very durable responses.  This could be due to different populations and there are questions about the dosing that is used for pembro.
NTL2:  There is a potential that pts with Lynch syndrome do worse but we need a better sample size to really judge.  It seems that these patients can have very late responses.
NTL2:  BMS may have more data in BRAF mutated pts in MSI CRC study but all of the pts that I have treated have responded
NTL3:   pseudoprogression real?
NTL2:  I think that there were a couple but they are not common.  Most responses are quite early.
NTL3:  I think it?s more of a myth.  Are you trying to lie to yourself and say it?s pseudoprogression to keep treating.
NTL3:  Do you think that there is potential for treating in the adjuvant setting rather than in tumor reductive setting?  
NTL2:  Melanoma data shows that there is great potential for immunotherapy in adjuvant.
NTL3:  When I see high responses across tumor types, I am now seeing that MSI testing is the most important thing.  Should we be testing for MSI in all patients?
NTL2:  It is hard to globally recommend MSI but if there is a potential for immunotherapy use, you should try.",60

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo.

Stated there was not strong enthusiasm of panel for the PDL-1 negative argument due to reasons we discussed internally, but also due to low numbers and at this point unpublished data (he stressed this).  That said given indication of atezo unlikely to get NCCN recommendation more restrictive than label.

Agreed with just about everybody else that 026 was surprise, likely trial design, etc.

On KN 021 stated panel felt the data way to early to recommend Chemo/Pembro in any way.  Had no opinion on whether IO/IO or IO/chemo likely to be superior

Stated NCCN was working on recommendation on how to use PDL-1 cutoffs in some future statement.  This is second NCCN panelist to mention this to me.  Other was in cHL.  Stated majority of effort was in the 1-100% area (as opposed to 0-3+)  Commended BMS for working with Ventana

Noted when voting any member whose name was on relevant paper must recuse self.","I met with NCCN panelist for SCLC (though sees mostly NSCLC) at an NCCN center in  midwest.  She offered these insights:

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

On the design of 026 she felt that BMS probably had good advice given to us at ad boards when designing trial but we did not listen (she did not expand on this)

She stated that her institution just started testing for PDL-1 in house.  Prior it took 2-3 weeks for results.  Now takes 2 days",243

He stated at his institution they almost exclusively use Opdivo in the lung setting.  He stated this was due to a strong rHe elationship with BMS, stressed his institutions clinical trial experience.  Stated they are using pembro in first line but there have not been many off study appropriate patients thus far.  He did not feel Nivo use has declined after ESMO or after Atezo approval.  Offered that they still do not have pembro on order sets.

He stated he has used single agent Nivo in SCLC but has yet to see a response.  He has recently switched to combo (he thought Nivo q2 and ipi 1 q 6 but was unsure)  Too early too judge.

On above he stated he has had no payer issues in SCLC using nivo or ipi/nivo

Thought that PDL-1 status was important in NSquamous, not in squamous

Stated he actually liked q2 over q3.  He stated most patients are local and it gives them a chance to monitor patients better.  He stated they are now dosing q2 for first 4 doses at institution.  After this patients go to central institution q 4 and go to a satellite institution with mostly NP for alternative dosing","Heather Copher-Sweeney and I recently met with a NTL/ Lymphoma NCCN panelist from an NCI-designated academic institution to discuss the role of I-O in the treatment of cHL. The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","Met with a regional oncology pharmacist manager AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI reactively mentioned that she?s observed instances of use of PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) as salvage therapy, in her institution, with unimpressive results.  
?	Due to the fact that her institution is not an IDN, comparative costs associated with IO therapy alternatives (eg. AE management costs associated with traditional Chemo) are not as important to them since they may generate revenue for interventions such as ER visits instead of being as sensitive to total spend for a patient.  
?	Due to this perspective, value measures such as the impact of seeing improved OS or positive impacts on quality of life are more important to her type of institution.  
?	She shared her institution?s P&T process as the following.  A physician (eg. Oncologist) requests an addition of a medication to formulary, which initiates pharmacy to create and present a drug monograph for P&T consideration.  With this info, the P&T committee then votes on this request for addition to formulary.  
?	The AI?s institution does have a formulary, but oncologists can order medicines not on formulary without a prior authorization process.  
?	If the medicine is on formulary, ease of access is faster since the medication is likely to be stocked by the infusion pharmacy.",305

?	When asked what data is needed for an NCCN update, he stated heavier weight is given for FDA approvals; however, phase II or better data will be reviewed. He stated there was not a standard endpoint required for a given category rating (ie OS for category 1).

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).

AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests.","Academic RTL and investigator on a Rova-T trial (DLL3-ADC) for SCLC stated that this agent ""is even more exciting that PD1's in SCLC"" and that he has seen some ""amazing"" responses.

Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%

Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed.

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo.","Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.",221

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.",191

?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.

BCBS Alabama partnered with AIM in development of their Oncology Select Pathways that began as a pilot in Q2 2015 with NSCLC being the only pathway that affected BMS which began full implementation in late 2015 and now with an expansion of pathways.

The updated and expanded pathways now include: 
-CML, (Gleevec is 1L recommendation, Sprycel and Tasigna are 1L recommendation for Intermediate to High Risk Disease,)
-Metastatic Melanoma (Opdivo is listed as only PD-1 as 1L recommendation as montherapy regardless of BRAF status, Yervoy listed as 2L regardless of BRAF status)
-Kidney Cancer (Opdivo is listed as 2L recommendation for Clear Cell)
-Myeloma (Empliciti not listed on pathway)  
-NSCLC (Opdivo remains the only PD-1 recommended for NSCLC 2L; updated to include any histology/pathology)  

Worksheets for the pathways summarized above can be reviewed here: https://www.bcbsal.org/providers/oncology.cfm","Product Wastage in APM setting:  Large community oncology practice 'successfully' reducing costs with Regional Payer APM- Premera BC.

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.

One RTL told me he will now go 3-4 months on a BRaf+MEK combo and then switch to a PD-1.  Several others have told me they are staying with a TKI combo until disease progression (>10 months)  since the rapidity of the progression seems to be less severe.

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","?

?	This led to a reactive discussion on the early 012 data which demonstrated nearly a doubling ORR based on expression levels
?	The AI then led a discussion on what a treating physician would do if a patient was progressing on Nivo and the 227 reads out positive for regimen (would a treating physician add ipi?)

?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.",520

TL commented that 2L cabo may make sense in patients with liver or bone mets.","Insights from medical oncologist giving featured podium presentation at pathology conference in NW territory: i) TL stated that only 22C3 guides 1L NSCLC decisions; ii) TL stated the following: ""In 2L NSCLC setting: if the tissue is PD-L1 positive, pembrolizumab is the therapy of choice. If the tissue is PD-L1 negative, atezolizumab and nivolumab are therapies of choice. Pembrolizumab is favored for PD-L1 positive patients""; iii) TL made the statement that ""FDA invented the term 'complementary diagnostics' just for the sake of 28-8 assay as FDA did not know what to do with this assay""; iv) TL is reflex testing using 22C3 for PD-L1 along with molecular testing (EGFR, ALK, ROS1); v) TL stated that ""22C3 is the test to do"".","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.",613
IO,Src Category, Congress: Presentation,8.15624233505,1.40998590732e-06,242,52,"In the context of an online lecture about IO role in NSCLC (NCCN 2016 Webex Congress Series), a NSCLC NCCN panelist made the following comment from the podium::
In study CM-012, very impressive results were observed with nivo+ipi regimen in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of ?1% and ?5%, but cohorts were very small. In KN-021, the pembro+ipi combination regimen was very toxic and more toxic than nivo+ipi. Let?s wait for results of CM-227.","In the context of an online lecture about IO role in NSCLC (NCCN 2016 Webex Congress Series), a NSCLC NCCN panelist made the following comment from the podium:

 KN-021 was a small phase II study. The high response rate, short time to response, improved PFS, and good safety profile observed in the pembro+CT arm are encouraging, but there was no OS benefit with this combination regimen. OS and safety results are extremely immature. Phase 1b study GP28328 of atezo+CT combination therapy has provided quite impressive results, but it included < 20 patients per group. It is too early to switch to IO+CT in 1L NSCLC. Let?s see what happens in a large phase III study.","In the context of an online lecture about IO role in NSCLC (NCCN 2016 Webex Congress Series), a NSCLC NCCN panelist made the following comment from the podium:

 ~80% of patients in 1L setting are PD-L1 low or negative. The future lies in combination therapies with the goal of obtaining durable responses and shifting survival KM curves higher. It is too early to tell if best results will be achieved by combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with other IO agents, chemo, RT, or targeted agents.",294
