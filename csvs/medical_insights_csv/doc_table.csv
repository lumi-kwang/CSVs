?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy).

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

-Currently, this TL believes that treatment/ sequencing decisions should be made by choosing which potential set of AEs a RCC patient is willing to endure since the AEs associated with Nivo and Cabo are so different.

TLs have also referenced the findings of Spranger et al. (Nature reference below) who investigated the gene-expression profiles of 266 cutaneous melanomas and divided them into inflamed and non-inflamed cohorts. They found that ?-catenin signaling was active in the non-inflamed cohort and an increased CTNNB1 (?-catenin) score was predictive for a lack of T-cell infiltration.  Reconstitution with Flt3 ligand dendritic cells reversed resistance to immunotherapy (anti-CTLA + anti-PD1). The WNT/?-catenin pathway may contribute to immune evasion in other tumor entities beyond melanoma and may represent one mechanism of primary resistance to immunotherapy.  This was investigated in ASCO 2016 abstract 8565 SCLC and similar trend was observed of increased ?-catenin signaling in non-inflamed phenotype and lack of t cell infiltration.  Two additional presentations mentioned were biomarkers in immunotherapy and inflammation as next checkpoint.

He shared the following insights:

On PDL-1 expression, when discussing the indications and trial designs of the current 2 agents, he proactively stated that felt rather strongly that the way the trials were designed should guide how the agents are used.  In discussing potential first line use, he stated that as pembrolizumab is being studied in this setting in the greater than 50% staining population, then pembro really should be limited in it?s use in that population.  He stated that if Nivo is studied in greater than 5% (or 1%), then Nivo should be used in that population.  He did not feel one agent should be used in a manner that was supported by another agents data

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ?market? pembro as the drug of choice in the ?positive? or ?high staining? patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

Andy discussed various trial information.  We also discussed NSCLC screening, which he felt his hospital was not doing enough of.

The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests.",2016-07-14 00:00:00, Clinical Trial; Competitor data, OPDIVO,,0.244344,0.11409,0.127146,0,0.494619375314,0.643370421846,0,0,0.771320197216,0

Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed.

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).",2016-06-28 00:00:00, Access Organization, OPDIVO,,0.114424,0.0814867,0.083847,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.

?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.

?

?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.

He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.

He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",2016-02-28 00:00:00, Other, OPDIVO; YERVOY,,0.0105507,0.0613757,0.0222547,0,0,0.615477663275,0,0,0,0

The reason for Price Protection should be self-evident in the media ? price inflation of prescription drugs has been excessive and exposes our clients to unpredictable costs when setting budgets/premiums/etc.   

As a result, clients are demanding that we enter ?fixed cost? contracts where the pricing of a product is predetermined based on a set WAC during the course of an agreement, or else a Price Protection ceiling above which the net cost effect of a manufacturer?s pricing strategy will not affect the plan?s cost for the product. 

Additionally, when looking to prefer products, Price Protection is becoming an increasingly important feature of rebate contracts. For example, if I have price protection for Xarelto and Pradaxa, but not Eliquis, clients may be inclined to select your competitors because of the predictable nature of the spend.   A single price increase by BMS/Pfizer could wipe out much or all of the rebate value for a plan over the course of a contract If they select your  product, while they can be assured that the decision to prefer the other products would make sure a plan can?t go too far astray during the life of the contract for competitors offering PP.",2016-12-09 00:00:00, Contracting, ELIQUIS; OPDIVO; ORENCIA; SPRYCEL,,1.0,1.0,-0.0344062,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab",2016-06-24 00:00:00, Competitor data, OPDIVO,,0.254733,0.160687,0.155786,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

uuid-ee6a077681c24307a30a1b263f77be26,"Met with a nationally recognized TL/AI NCCN lung panelist who shared the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.",2016-03-25 00:00:00, Access Organization; Competitor data; Health economics & outcomes research, OPDIVO; Opdivo Lung,,1.0,0.0526629,-0.0211922,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0456923958918

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.

uuid-7e8e56a316e743f78c9a98ff39a96ce7,"A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
