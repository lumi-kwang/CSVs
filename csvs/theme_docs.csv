Medical Insights cHL,"TL, discussed, lymphoma, inhibitors","A regional lymphoma TL delivered a presentation on ""therapeutic potential of MAbs in cHL"", at a regional hematology-oncology meeting. A national TL asked him ? out of these, which one is your favorite antibody and why? The speaker said-NIVOLUMAB; because of its safety, durable clinical benefit/remission, and potential for combination with other small molecules and checkpoint inhibitors.","Heather Copher-Sweeney and I recently met with a NTL/ Lymphoma NCCN panelist from an NCI-designated academic institution to discuss the role of I-O in the treatment of cHL. The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","RTL at academic practice stated that he is, ""very impressed"" with the response rates of OPDIVO in cHL patients.  He stated he his getting ready to initiate therapy for a cHL patient.  Had no concerns with Allo data when the cHL deck was presented.  Did ask for me to come back to present and educate his nurses on Opdivo, he said you forget BMT units have no Opdivo experience and are way behind in Opdivo education since they have no experience with solid tumors.

?	AI thinks that BV is moving to front line status in practice, especially with Bleomycin shortage, which elevates the need for combination trials involving nivolumab with other agents.
?	She stated that BV moving into the front line was an opportunity for Nivo to conduct more trials using combinations of agents, particularly because the current BV data in the 2L will no longer be applicable.

?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.

?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.

Speaker noted that the preference for use of cetuximab in elderly and poor performance status patients may however be a factor contributing to not as good responses seen with cetuximab.","Following a reactive presentation of Checkmate -141, an academic H&N cancer TL stated ?we should look at Nivolumab in recurrent or metastatic platinum refractory SCCHN patients who have an ECOG performance status of 2 given that these patients are not candidate for chemotherapy. The TL further commented ?I would expect this patient population to tolerate Nivolumab well given its favorable safety profile?.","RTL stated it is ""muddy"" when choosing between nivo and pembro in the NSCLC space (as well as H&N cancer); for 1L NSCLC patients, the decision between pembro and chemo typically falls upon the patient's performance status, QOL, etc rather than PDL1 status; occasionally will choose to save the PD1 inhibitor and try chemo first in the healthier patients; if the decision is made to try a PD1 inhibitor instead of chemo, they typically will use it in a 1L patient regardless of PDL1 status"
Medical Insights H&N,"H&N cancer, OS, Opdivo, dosing","ENT/H&N surgeon is excited to add Opdivo to his arsenal of Tx options in SCCHN. TL said he would be referring several patients to the local med-onc. However, TL said his ENT office staff could use education around IMARs because patients often will call his office for advice, even after being handed off to the med-onc.  TL said patients strike up a very strong relationship with the surgeon, who is often the first physician to correctly diagnose and treat the disease.  TL requested an in-service by our IOCL (currently in training).","Spoke with a LTL for H&N.  He was aware that Pembro is FDA approved for H&N, but he stated that the Merck Reps have not been around to promote the indication yet.  He also added that he is going to tell them that he is going to continue to use Nivolumab in his H&N pts because of the phenomenal support program (BMS Access support) that BMS has and the success that he has had getting access to Nivo. He added, if for some reason Nivo was denied, only then would he consider using pembro.","In a group discussion with multi-disciplinary H&N team (Surgeons, RadOncs, MedOncs), TLs were very excited about efficacy & tolerability of Opdivo. Regarding the post-platinum indication, several TLs asked about use in patients who are ineligible for platinum chemo (due to age/comorbidities). One TL suggested potentially giving just one dose of chemo to satisfy the requirement of being post-platinum. This is reminiscent of similar comments heard from other TLs soon after 2L NSCLC approval.","After reactive discussing the positive OS data announcement with CA209-141 for H&N, the RTL actually asked for a copy of the BMS Press Release.  Upon inquiring further why the need for a copy of the press release, the RTL shared that with that information in hand, he stated that they can start using nivolumab for H&N without having insurance companies pushing back on it.  The TL was excited to have another option for his H&N pts and was eager to start using it.","ENT/H&N surgeon said OS benefit in Checkmate141 is ""amazing"".

3.	Explained that one of his patients tested 0% PDL1+ before chemo and then tested again after chemo and was 90% PDL1
a.	He said in general PDL1 test(s) are currently inadequate; UPMC performs two different tests (different platforms - Ventana/Dako 22C3) to confirm expression
4.	He said he doesn?t really know about the pathology details around which clone of antibody used for PDL1 test
5.	Discussed the 026 data at ESMO and the H&N approval and placement on the VIA pathways
6.	We spoke about 227 design and combo dosing moving forward
7.	He asked if we are still using a 1% or 5% cutoff in 227
8.	Talked about phase I vs Phase III data deciding factor for nivo vs pembro in H&N pathway
a.	Ellis was very direct and stated phase I data should not be used for FDA approvals","NTL thinks Pembro and Nivo are equivalent. At this point in the life-cycle of the two agents, phase III vs phase I/II data doesn't make any difference. TL said the choice now comes down to cost and convenience. Clearly Pembro wins on Q3W convenience. So Nivo will need to win on cost. Currently, with weight-based dosing for H&N, Nivo is slightly cheaper for the local population. But if Opdivo switches to flat-dosing for H&N, that cost advantage will be lost, so Pembro will again win on convenience of dosing.","Regional H&N TL volunteered his opinion regarding the differences in data between pembro and nivo in H&N: he said that it is interesting that the ORR reported with pembro in H&N has steadily dropped each time the data is presented. He said it started around 27% and then dropped to 20-ish percent and now their label has it at 16%. He also commented that you cant really compare the 13% ORR seen in checkmate 141 with the 16% in keynote 012 given the different percentage of HPV+ and PDL1+ patients enrolled between the two studies. He stated that clearly Merck enrolled more patients that are PDL1+ and if the 141 study had as many PDL1+ patients, the ORR there would be higher than 012's data.","National H&N TL indicated during GR that KN-012 showed ""only a smattering of CRs"" and that one should remember the tail of the curve ""represents only 4 patients"".",TL commented that the PD-L2 and IFNg signature data from KN-012 is a start but was not convinced by the ROC curves (r-0.73 isn't great). He does feel there is a need for useful biomarkers in H&N due to cost and imAEs associated with I-O therapy.
Medical Insights H&N,"nivolumab, tumor, toxicity, response","TL feels that tumor mutational burden should be measured in Head and Neck trials. States that all humans are exposed to radiation over time and some cells develop resistance to radiation as a result, which is the theory why radiation therapy at times fails. Feels that HPV negative patients are being left behind, and feels that tumor mutational burden may have a relation to nivo responses in these patients.","TL shared that she is currently combining nivolumab with radiation (quad shot) to potentially improve response in patients with incurable H&N. She has treated 12 patients with this approach so far with no increase in toxicity . She did say it is too early to know anything about long term outcomes, but seems to be a safe approach and not having to delay immunotherapy.","RTL participating in Pembro 1L H&N trial (KN-048) stated that it is about halfway through enrollment.  States that they have enrolled about 6 patients, a couple randomized to each arm (Pembro vs. Pembro+chemo vs. cetux/cembo) and has seen some stabilization of disease but not marked responses.  Shared that they haven't seen any unexpected toxicity (ie, the pembr+chemo does not seem to have additive toxicity) but TL stated that he thinks that PD-1+cetux would be the better combination and hopes that we will plan on investigating.","Within a large community practice that has has not tested for PDL1 in NSCLC and exclusively used nivo, several MDs shared unsolicited reactions around 141 survival data that they has seen summarized on OncLive (did not attend AACR).  Were very positive around data and stated that while PDL1 difference was 'again interesting', but that they would not test in this patient population because 'toxicity alone is superior' - their SOC is cetux in this pop and they are at edge of hypersensitivity belt.

Medical Insights Lung,"discussed, AI, provided the following unsolicited insights, approval","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.
?	He mentioned that the NCCN NSCLC panel has been busy with recent updates with Pembro and consideration of Atezo data, with emails flying around the group.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium and in conversation.
?	PDL1 testing is imperfect, but it helps to find patients who may respond.  Even if there is no expression, it doesn't mean the patient won't respond.
?	She says there is a JCO publication looking at pneumonitis with pd1, pdl1, and ctla4 therapies, showing this adverse event is agnostic to the type of CA, but it may be more frequently observed with CTLA4 therapy.
?	She emphasized that in KN 024, a high number of patients were screened to winnow down to the randomized population, around 15%.
o	She expressed that even with crossover of ~40% in the KN study, the OS looks good.
?	In the context of CM 026 being negative, she stated and understood that the trial was conducted very differently from KN 024, in terms of the primary endpoint and PDL1 cutoffs.
o	There are still lots of questions still to resolve, and lots to chew on.
?	It?s too soon to make a judgment about 1L data, but chemo will still have a role in 1L.
?	In conversation, she stated:
o	She admitted she hasn't had time to delve into CM 026 data yet since she was on call during the ESMO weekend.
o	She agreed to a subsequent meeting to discuss more in depth.
o	She thinks that the CM 026 negative result may have to do with study design itself.  
o	This is not the final answer on this question as there is still lots to learn about 1L therapy.
o	She believes that the future may be combination therapy (IO or chemo).","Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery.","Met with a national lung AI/TL and advisor to NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	AI was debating from the podium for use of single agent Immunotherapy (PD1) in Squamous NSCLC
o	In the context of a debate, she stated that PD1 agents should be the standard of care for initial therapy in SQ NSCLC specifically.
o	She expressed that with CM 026 specificially in SQ NSCLC, based upon the subgroup HR analysis, the PFS was still higher than in CM 017.  
o	She referenced the impressive OS in CM 012 1L OS (19m)
o	She showed the subgroup analysis from CM 026, showing that for the SQ subgroup specifically, the HR was the lowest of all the subgroups evaluated.
o	She pointed to the much lower grade 3-4 AE?s seen with chemo compared to chemotherapy.","Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.

Another family practice physician involved in formulary decisions called the Opdivo TV ads ?cringe-inducing?.  He complained that the overall tenor of the TV ad grossly exaggerates the modest improvement in median overall survival produced by Opdivo in NSCLC.",Lung RTL shared that BMS will have an uphill climb trying to convince physicians how to use the regimen if CM-227 is positive.  He feels that physicians are scared off by the noise Ipi is creating in the adjuvant melanoma setting.  He commented that lung treaters at the institution level are asking their melanoma colleagues for guidance on how to manage toxicities with IO agents and if they haven't had positive experiences with Ipi then the rest of the treaters at the institution will have a skewed view of the drug.,"Lung RTL shared that once Pembro is approved in the front-line space this will effect Opdivo use in the second line setting.

-in an effort to improve their position when negotiating with payers, the practice is looking to design qualitative pathways beginning with the areas of lung, breast, prostate, and colon.
-a serious concern was physician pushback to pathways, and since this AI is tasked with quality and data management, a potential solution was discussed where past physician prescribing behavior could be captured and used to create pathways in order to minimize physician resistance. Referred to this as ""reverse pathway.""    
-in addition, other qualitative metrics will be put in place and are compiled from OCM, CMS, QOPI, COA, ASCO, among others. 
-at an upcoming community oncology conference, this AI also expects to present data showing how community practices are providing greater value to payers by offering comparable care to academic centers at a significant fraction of the cost.","Lung RTL at an academic institution shared that based on the recent approval with Atezolizumab that it will be a ""no brainer"" that he'll be using this in the second line space given the Q3W dosing."

He said that he thinks it is assay related. We discussed blueprint and he referenced a recent IASLC presentation that also showed concordance between the 22C3 and 28-8 antibodies. in contrast to Blueprint however, he has a paper submitted for review right now that shows 22C3 is more sensitive than 28-8 based on a 1% cut.

?	AI expressed frustration that the one test they can perform in-house is the Ventana (Atezo) assay, for which they recently bought a machine.

The TL is aware of the Project Blueprint data and does not believe this test should be used.  The TL noted that this might hurt Merck since the SP142 test seems to read consistently lower than the Dako tests and could turn >50% staining to less than and thus out of label for Pembro.

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?","Contacted by community physician regarding some general questions on Nivolumab.  He started treatment on a patient with Lupus recently on nivolumab who has metastatic lung cancer.

This physician then shared that he has been in touch with a national TL who recommended that he treat a melanoma patient with unknown primary who has been resected free of disease with adjuvant Ipilimumab therapy.  He was not aware of the labeled dosing for adjuvant tx and discussion took place surrounding the differences for use in the adjuvant setting as well as recommendation to contact BMS Access Support Services regarding obtaining drug should he choose to move forward.","Biomedical Learning Institute 1st Annual Symposium on Integrating Immune Therapies & Target Therapies into Standards of Care for Heme and Solid Malignancies; San Fran Sept 10, 2016 
Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL

?	CM 017 (SQ NSCLC)
?	Field should be moving from focusing on median improvement of PFS/OS to focusing on evaluating for the tail of the curve (as sign of on-going response)
?	Showed CM 017, urged to focus on tail of the curve.  Showed percentage of patients who had prolonged on-going duration of response, in responders
?	In regards to CM 057
o	Showed PDL1 expression demographics of patients
o	Said mDOR of 17.2 months with Nivo versus 5months with Docetaxel  is incredible, compared to OS seen with chemo treatments.  
?	Emphasized this as impressive
o	He said some doctors say Nivo is good choice even in non-expressors, considering its much more tolerable AE profile, and perhaps should be SOC.
?	In regards to CM 057, highlighted ~9% response in non-expressors
o	Said this is as good a response as docetaxel (response rate), with a better AE profile
?	PDL1 expression is affected by where in the tumor you acquire tissue to do the PDL1 analysis
?	He described a patient who has been off treatment for 2.5 y, and has had no clinical signs of progression to this day (got PD1 inhibitor starting in 2/12).
?	In regards to CM 012,?
o	In melanoma, this regimen much more toxic
o	In lung, CM 012, have not seen this toxicity
?	In regards to KN 024,?
o	Small trial for today?s standards (n=305)
o	PDL1 greater than 50%
o	Did allow for cross-over, keep in mind when think about data that is public.
?	PDL1 testing should be incorporated into initial evaluation of NSCLC treatment in 1L."
Medical Insights Lung,"2L, pts, Atezo, nivo and pembro","A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance","Biomedical Learning Institute 1st Annual Symposium on Integrating Immune Therapies & Target Therapies into Standards of Care for Heme and Solid Malignancies; San Fran Sept 10, 2016

H&N: Stated Nivo is new standard of care","During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from 5 NCCN panelists or NTLs regarding the evolving NSCLC management landscape, with particular focus on KN-024, CM-026, and PD-L1 testing.
Unanimous that even without cross-trial comparison, Nivo, Pembro, and Atezo have comparable efficacy in 2L.
?	When asked how to decide which of  the 3 checkpoint inhibitors to use in 2L:
-AI/ TL #1: no real differences and you?re going to use the drug ?you grew up with??those like him that participated in Nivo trials will likely stick with Nivo because of familiarity
-AI/ TL #2: no testing and most convenient
1) doesn?t need more paperwork and will avoid filling out forms to test, which eliminates Pembro from consideration
2) Q3W > Q2W, so will use Atezo over Nivo
-AI/ TL #3: PD-1s ORR generally better than PD-L1s ORR, even though comparable OS","RTL (lung) stated that pembro will now make PDL1 testing more standard in the front line but that he still views the two drugs (nivo/pembro) as ""Coke and Pepsi"", despite the results of one failed study, and suggested that he would continue to use nivolumab as a 2L agent given the activity that has been shown in pts regardless of PDL1 expression. He failed to mention anything about KN010 being added to pembro label as well as atezo coming to market.","Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients."

Medical Insights Melanoma,"physician, NTL, considering, concerned","Part of a matrix presentation to a State Oncology Society.  As part of our discussion with the society staff and physician leadership, the following insights were obtained:

1. Significant dissatisfaction with BMS over the use of television marketing.  Two physicians present both indicated they felt that the use of commercials for Nivolumab was unethical.  One physician stated he felt it was ""morally irreprehensible"" and expressed extreme frustration at having to take time with patients to explain why they aren't candidates for Nivolumab that he would have been using to discuss the treatment he was going to be prescribing for them.  The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

5.  One physician did comment on treating a 90+ y/o patient with nivolumab with metastatic melanoma who decided to stop treatment after two doses.  The patient went on palliative care following that, but the physician is getting texts every 3 weeks from the patient's son indicating that the large lesion on his father's back continues to regress and the patient is doing very well.

6.  One physician downloaded our Opdivo APP while we were meeting with the group!","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial

When inquiring for more information as to why, all 3 said they initially wanted to use the Nivo/Ipi regimen; however, they contacted a local melanoma national thought leader who recommended pembro monotherapy.  All 3 practices are 2-4 hours from the NTL, who does not believe that the regimen should be given in the community.","In a joint meeting with MSL and HSL, melanoma RTL voiced concerns over high costs of Ipi+Nivo regimen and stated that his institution is considering rounding up/down doses to eliminate wastage of part-used vials and thereby reduce costs.
HSL touched on approved value-based information (median # of doses etc), which RTL found interesting. Due to time constraints in the current meeting, RTL invited HSL to meet another time to review this information in more detail.","I met with a melanoma NTL and he brought up the NYT article on IO AEs. He shared that he thought it was a favorable article at the end but it was not a ?balance of what we are up against when we are dealing with the kind of disease that kills everyone.? He shared that the article did not get at the fact that a certain amount of toxicity is the point and that generally toxicity manifestation can shorten therapy time.  He added that if colitis is seen, a few days on steroids followed by a dose of infliximab is enough to take care of it. Diabetes and endocrine issues can effect patients long-term but they are not the end of the world. He did express concern that there is under-reported joint pain and fatigue that can be seen with a PD-1 monotherapy that can last for 6- 12 months after treatment. 

He shared that there is a need for strong education of patients and that education for oncologists is needed in educating patients. He further shared a recent discussion with a community oncologist who does not see his regimen patients every three weeks (they are seen by his nurse after the first dose). He was shocked by this and emphasized the importance of not only seeing the patient before each dose but also between the 2nd and 3rd dose. 

The NYT article seemed to strike a nerve with him and he wants to become more involved in safety management education including education at ERs through the hospital system with which he is associated."

Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS moves of its therapeutic agents from 2L to 1L setting is too precipitous and scientifically unsound. In 1L setting what matters most is that treatment offers some benefit to as many patients who receive it as possible, not that treatment offers substantial benefit to a small fraction of patients and nothing to another larger fraction of treated patients.","A LAI/RTL/former melanoma NCCN panelist/Assoc. Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:

?	 Suggested that the following factors probably contributed to the negative results: inclusion of very low PDL1 expressors and low power resulting in major imbalances between groups. 
?	Commented that the PFS KM curves were baffling. Asked if pseudoprogressions in the nivo arm might have played a role (noted that pseudoprogressions seem to be rarer with NSCLC than melanoma, but first follow-up assessment in CM-026 took place early at 6 wks).
?	Suggested that nivo had shown no clinical activity in CM-026.

TL felt this topic was discussed more at ASCO this year and data presented was informative.,"Part of a matrix presentation to a State Oncology Society.  As part of our discussion with the society staff and physician leadership, the following insights were obtained:

1. Significant dissatisfaction with BMS over the use of television marketing.  Two physicians present both indicated they felt that the use of commercials for Nivolumab was unethical.  One physician stated he felt it was ""morally irreprehensible"" and expressed extreme frustration at having to take time with patients to explain why they aren't candidates for Nivolumab that he would have been using to discuss the treatment he was going to be prescribing for them.  The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

5.  One physician did comment on treating a 90+ y/o patient with nivolumab with metastatic melanoma who decided to stop treatment after two doses.  The patient went on palliative care following that, but the physician is getting texts every 3 weeks from the patient's son indicating that the large lesion on his father's back continues to regress and the patient is doing very well.

6.  One physician downloaded our Opdivo APP while we were meeting with the group!"

Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system","Large community practice with a patient with widely metastatic melanoma.

o	Underscores the point that providers have to be patient in waiting for immunotherapy responses on treatment.
?	In regards to PDL1 expression,?
o	The picture is murky
o	Because we see responses in some PDL1 negative pts, expression is not ?go or no go? factor in treatment
?	He says hopefully in the future we will have an algorithm to guide who to treat with monotherapy versus combo.
?	He raised the question of what is the optimal sequence to treat patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor and PD1 inhibitors, since there are some current studies with patients going on PD1 inhibitor therapy after BRAF inhibitor who showed responses.  
o	Do we treat with BRAF/MEK inhibitors first and then PD1, or other way around?

o	Optimal duration of therapy

o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)","Academic NTL in melanoma shared that he prefers to use the regimen in treating most patients and that he is suspicious of a ?kinder, gentler approach? to treatment that is being investigated. He further shared that he is interested in seeing GMCSF data in combination with ipi/nivo with long-term follow up to see whether toxicities might be reduced. He also shared that he feels that there is a data gap in patients who fail ipi/nivo and that giving more doses would be a good way to elicit a response. He also shared that he thought that the nano-strings approach to understanding which patients would respond to PD-1 therapy looked promising.","Community HCPs shared that they had attended a recent Merck Dinner program on melanoma and that speaker was strongly emphasizing that 1L pembro was the most appropriate trx choice as the ipi/nivo regimen is too toxic for most patients to handle and only those that are PDL1 showed increased benefit.  HCP shared that his take-away was that he should test for PDL1 and use pembro monotherapy for any level of PDL1 positivity by ""any IHC test"". HCP was also unaware that the majority of data presented by Merck was at 10mg/kg dose.","A regional melanoma TL shared with me that he initially started a melanoma patient on Pembro, but the patient showed no response.  He then switched the patient to the Ipi/Nivo regimen and has since started responding.  He was hesitant to use the combination upfront because of the potential of toxicity, but now he thinks that the regimen should be used upfront in otherwise healthy patients, and as salvage therapy for monotx progressers."

For this, he gives no break in treatment when he sees a lack of response but just goes right into the regimen on the next cycle with reduced dose of nivo.",A community HCP felt that single agent nivolumab would be a more appropriate choice in 1L metastatic melanoma for patients with low disease burden and the combo of ipi+nivo would be only appropriate in those melanoma patients with high burden of disease needing rapid response,"Local community TL in commenting on CM-026 results of PD1 monotherapy not being enough in 1L broad NSCLC patient population, he does feel IO-IO combo is the answer as he truly feels there needs to be something priming the immune system in addition to PD1 therapy, however he does feel ipi is far too toxic and other combos of nivo should be focused on more; TL stated that NSCLC patients are often more beaten down than melanoma patients so while he does feel there can perhaps remain a role for ipi+nivo in melanoma, another IO+nivo option will be better for NSCLC patients","Met with a regional melanoma AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",A melanoma RTL from NY volunteered that they continue to met resistance from Insurers giving Pre-Authorization for dosing Infliximab to a patient that is currently admitted to the hospital for management of a steroid refractory Immune Mediated Adverse reaction. The TL noted that the issue occurs when the Melanoma service elects to go to Infliximab after I.V. steroids have not been successful in controlling the AE.  The Tl stated that the Hospital has had no issues proscribing Infliximab in the out-patient setting.  The TL suggested it would far simpler to go right to Infliximab if oral steroids are not successful in managing the IrAE.  The Tl also urged BMS to get involved in helping address this issue with Insurers.,"In regard to efficacy vs safety of using regimen for 1L metastatic Melanoma treatment:  

Regional TL stated:  Steroids are being used so much faster in solid tumor inpatient treatment for AEs.  Even more than just 1 year ago.  Anyone who sees that a patient is on I/O therapy has been pulling the trigger on steroids first, asking questions second.

-This TL doesn?t believe that the difference in mOS between Nivo and Cabo is significant, and doesn?t see 21 months versus more than 2 years of survival as a determining factor when choosing a treatment option. 
-Currently, this TL believes that treatment/ sequencing decisions should be made by choosing which potential set of AEs a RCC patient is willing to endure since the AEs associated with Nivo and Cabo are so different. He concedes that oral versus IV, or physician preference of back-to-back TKIs versus sandwiching Nivo between 2 TKIs also play a role in choosing a treatment option.
-The TL did mention that if Nivo is able to reproduce in RCC the long OS tail seen in melanoma, then Nivo will be the standard in 2L and Cabo would be relegated to 3L."

- pace of progression (20% of pts exhibiting faster progression prefers TKI) 
- toxicity of 1L VEGF TKI (if had minimal tox/dose reduction, more likely to give cabo 2L due to convience of oral dosing)
- compliance to taking oral meds and reporting of side effects
- Performance status (lower PS would always get nivo)","GU TL shared his treatment-decision algorithm in RCC:
1L - VEGF TKI (currently pazopanib, but though CABO-SUN looked goog)

Does not expect this to change dramatically with entry of cabo, however stated that cab will now be his preferred 2L/3L TKI instead of axitinib that he currently uses.  He would consider  levantnib+everolimus following cabo as believes value in adding a mTOR.  While TL believes that OS endpt trumps all, that especially for older patients, PFS endpoint is also very meaningful.","At an academic Grand Rounds, TL shared from podium that he was confident that nivo would remain clear 2L SOC for RCC even with cabozatanib demonstrating a significant OS benefit due to durability and favorable tox.

However, if the primary grows rapidly, or if there are more than 2 new lesions then that is most likely true progression and it is unlikely that continuing IO therapy will sway the balance.","GU RTL states that while he prefers to give nivolumab 2L in RCC patients, that he uses cabozatanib in patients who are progressing ""fast"" as he is concerned that IO works too slowly.  When asked to elaborate on his definition of 'fast progressors' he stated that it is at most 25% of patients and that he can often tell speed of progression by clinical appearances (PS, pain, fatigue) rather than scans.  

He stated that even in 'moderate pace' progressors, that at least 50% of the patients have their disease 'explode' once they come off of their 1L TKI, sometimes to the point he has no choice by to put them back on.  He had considered 'bridging' in nivolumab while weaning off the TKI but was concerned about safety.  Reactively reviewed TKI+nivo safety data from 209-017 and he thought that this was very acceptable and that he may begin to do this.","Based on the median time to response and higher number of 'late' responses in 025, coupled with the overall slower progression of RCC patients, TL is considering doing first scan at 12 weeks rather than 8-9 weeks as he think it may better reflect the benefit without showing as much pseudoprogression.","GU TL shared his treatment-decision algorithm in RCC:

* Physician unaware of 2L approval in RCC - data shared

*Physician unaware of 2L approval in non-squamous NSCLC, data shared.  Same physician stated he hadn't seen much benefit in using Nivo, but also stated he has treated several squamous histology patients.  Noted he is also treating a small cell patient off label with Nivo

*Physician stated he didn't know how we (especially me as a clinician) could be positive about our IO agents due to their extraordinary costs and drain on the economy.

He states that 'any improvement is great but toxicity is still a concern' but that he doesn't feel that ipi is the ""right dance partner"" for nivo in GU tumors. At this point, TL would most like to see data on PD1+IDO for RCC.  

TL is not very excited for IO+TKI combos as he feels that the toxicity is going to be a 1+1 = 10, however we did discuss the NCI nivo+cabo Apolo data and he was 'pleasantly surprised'.","Large community RTL who sees most of practices GU patients (but also treats other tumor types) shared that while he is universally using nivolumab for all of his 2L RCC (n~6) patients (primarily due to toxicity profile vs. TKIs) he has seen very responses and even SD seems to be limited in duration. Has been overall disappointed.  TL notes that he has actually had 'amazing' resulting in the NSCLC and melanoma patients he has treated, so his expectations were very high for RCC.","A regional GU TL at an NCI designated cancer center expressed that he was eagerly awaiting the results of CaboSun and -214.  He said that if CaboSun is positive, he will definitely treat his first line RCC patients with cabozantinib; but he would be amenable to Nivo plus Ipi if it was just as good as cabo.","Community LTL of a large practice shared that they are routinely using Foundation One with each patient to provide a personalized medicine approach. Even though PD-L1 testing is available, they do not use the results for treatment decisions and would never consider it relevant for RCC."
Medical Insights RCC,"treats, combination, cabozantinib, sunitinib",An academic GU TL does not use cabozantinib or lenvatinib/everolimus combo in 2L mRCC. This TL prefers Nivolumab because of its efficacy and safety profile.,A RCC TL when discussing the RCC treatment landscape does not feel that the approval of cabozantinib or the approval of lenvatinib plus everolimus will have any impact on how he currently is treating his patients.  Both will be reserved for later lines of therapy.,Academic TL shared that he is not that excited about the Eisai trial investigating lenvatinib/everolimus or lenvatinib/pembrolizumab vs sunitinib alone in 1L aRCC. It's another TKI study...unsure if they will participate.,"Thomas Hudson DO (Texas A&M, US Oncology/McKesson) discussed the challenge of sequencing TKI therapies and IO agents in kidney cancers.  He indicated that cabozantinib might replace sunitinib in first line therapy for clear cell RCC, if the final results reflect the improvement in PFS already released by a press release from Exelixis.  However, he was dismissive of either of the new TKIs (cabozantinib and lenvatinib) as second line therapy in RCC.  His patients are well educated and are demanding IO therapy.  In addition, there is no data to indicate superiority for TKIs over nivolumab in this setting.  The next generation TKIs will be relegated to third line therapy after IO failure.","David McDermott MD (BIDMC Boston) an expert on melanoma and RCC, and a leading clinical trials leader discussed the safety issues in using checkpoint inhibitors in patients with autoimmune disorders.  He made a cautious endorsement, pointing out the range of possible results with ipilimumab (Johnson DB, Jama Oncol. 2016).  Despite being treated with immune modulatory therapy to treat immune-mediated AEs, many patients maintained the response of ipilimumab, including one complete response.  He also presented one of his cases, a patient with metastatic melanoma and psoriatic arthritis who was treated with pembrolizumab.  When the psoriatic arthritis flared, the patient was treated with apremilast (a PDE4 inhibitor) without compromising efficacy of pembrolizumab.  He also presented the data from Weber (2015) publication in JCO, to point out that immunosuppressants does not appear to affect the efficacy of nivolumab either."
