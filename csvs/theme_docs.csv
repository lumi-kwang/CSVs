Medical Insights Melanoma,"physician, NTL, considering, concerned","Part of a matrix presentation to a State Oncology Society.  As part of our discussion with the society staff and physician leadership, the following insights were obtained:

1. Significant dissatisfaction with BMS over the use of television marketing.  Two physicians present both indicated they felt that the use of commercials for Nivolumab was unethical.  One physician stated he felt it was ""morally irreprehensible"" and expressed extreme frustration at having to take time with patients to explain why they aren't candidates for Nivolumab that he would have been using to discuss the treatment he was going to be prescribing for them.  The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

5.  One physician did comment on treating a 90+ y/o patient with nivolumab with metastatic melanoma who decided to stop treatment after two doses.  The patient went on palliative care following that, but the physician is getting texts every 3 weeks from the patient's son indicating that the large lesion on his father's back continues to regress and the patient is doing very well.

6.  One physician downloaded our Opdivo APP while we were meeting with the group!","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)","On 3 separate occasions this month, I have spoken with different regional to local physicians who indicated that they are starting new melanoma patients on pembrolizumab.  When inquiring for more information as to why, all 3 said they initially wanted to use the Nivo/Ipi regimen; however, they contacted a local melanoma national thought leader who recommended pembro monotherapy.  All 3 practices are 2-4 hours from the NTL, who does not believe that the regimen should be given in the community.","In a joint meeting with MSL and HSL, melanoma RTL voiced concerns over high costs of Ipi+Nivo regimen and stated that his institution is considering rounding up/down doses to eliminate wastage of part-used vials and thereby reduce costs.
HSL touched on approved value-based information (median # of doses etc), which RTL found interesting. Due to time constraints in the current meeting, RTL invited HSL to meet another time to review this information in more detail.","I met with a melanoma NTL and he brought up the NYT article on IO AEs. He shared that he thought it was a favorable article at the end but it was not a ?balance of what we are up against when we are dealing with the kind of disease that kills everyone.? He shared that the article did not get at the fact that a certain amount of toxicity is the point and that generally toxicity manifestation can shorten therapy time.  He added that if colitis is seen, a few days on steroids followed by a dose of infliximab is enough to take care of it. Diabetes and endocrine issues can effect patients long-term but they are not the end of the world. He did express concern that there is under-reported joint pain and fatigue that can be seen with a PD-1 monotherapy that can last for 6- 12 months after treatment. 

He shared that there is a need for strong education of patients and that education for oncologists is needed in educating patients. He further shared a recent discussion with a community oncologist who does not see his regimen patients every three weeks (they are seen by his nurse after the first dose). He was shocked by this and emphasized the importance of not only seeing the patient before each dose but also between the 2nd and 3rd dose. 

The NYT article seemed to strike a nerve with him and he wants to become more involved in safety management education including education at ERs through the hospital system with which he is associated."
Medical Insights Melanoma,"shared, institution, Melanoma RTL, academic","A LAI/RTL/former melanoma NCCN panelist/Assoc. Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	A company proposing a biosimilar to nivo accompanied by a highly-predictive biomarker may be able to steal BMS current competitive advantage.","A LAI/RTL/former melanoma NCCN panelist/Assoc. Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS moves of its therapeutic agents from 2L to 1L setting is too precipitous and scientifically unsound. In 1L setting what matters most is that treatment offers some benefit to as many patients who receive it as possible, not that treatment offers substantial benefit to a small fraction of patients and nothing to another larger fraction of treated patients.","A LAI/RTL/former melanoma NCCN panelist/Assoc. Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:

?	 Suggested that the following factors probably contributed to the negative results: inclusion of very low PDL1 expressors and low power resulting in major imbalances between groups. 
?	Commented that the PFS KM curves were baffling. Asked if pseudoprogressions in the nivo arm might have played a role (noted that pseudoprogressions seem to be rarer with NSCLC than melanoma, but first follow-up assessment in CM-026 took place early at 6 wks).
?	Suggested that nivo had shown no clinical activity in CM-026. After being reminded that PFS, OS, and ORR were similar in both study arms, agreed that it was more appropriate to conclude that nivo had an efficacy similar to that of CT in PDL1 ?5% NSCLC, with a better safety profile.",Melanoma TL commented that management of patients with I-O and autoimmune disease hasn't been addressed.

Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system","Large community practice with a patient with widely metastatic melanoma.

He went on to say that even pts. that are deemed negative have a 13% response rate which is still higher than chemo or IPI alone.,"a national/regional melanoma AI and NCCN melanoma Panelist provided the following insights from the podium at a Immuno-oncology CME event.

?	MOA of nivo/ipi are synergistic.
?	Showed case of pt responding to ipi with initial worsening on ipi, then complete remission later
o	Underscores the point that providers have to be patient in waiting for immunotherapy responses on treatment.
?	In regards to PDL1 expression,?
o	The picture is murky
o	Because we see responses in some PDL1 negative pts, expression is not ?go or no go? factor in treatment
?	He says hopefully in the future we will have an algorithm to guide who to treat with monotherapy versus combo.
?	He raised the question of what is the optimal sequence to treat patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor and PD1 inhibitors, since there are some current studies with patients going on PD1 inhibitor therapy after BRAF inhibitor who showed responses.  
o	Do we treat with BRAF/MEK inhibitors first and then PD1, or other way around?
?	He noted these are the unanswered questions currently?
o	Optimal duration of therapy
o	Biomarkers to predict response
o	Combo v. sequential"
Medical Insights Melanoma,"Nivo, Ipi, combination, Pembro","A NTL in melanoma shared that combination IO therapy (mostly regimen) is their primary method of treatment all melanoma pts at their institution.  Even if the pts has bully, BRAF+ melanoma, because of the rapid RR scene with Nivo/Ipi, they would choose Nivo/Ipi over BRAF+MEK combo.","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)","Academic NTL in melanoma shared that he prefers to use the regimen in treating most patients and that he is suspicious of a ?kinder, gentler approach? to treatment that is being investigated. He further shared that he is interested in seeing GMCSF data in combination with ipi/nivo with long-term follow up to see whether toxicities might be reduced. He also shared that he feels that there is a data gap in patients who fail ipi/nivo and that giving more doses would be a good way to elicit a response. He also shared that he thought that the nano-strings approach to understanding which patients would respond to PD-1 therapy looked promising.","Community HCPs shared that they had attended a recent Merck Dinner program on melanoma and that speaker was strongly emphasizing that 1L pembro was the most appropriate trx choice as the ipi/nivo regimen is too toxic for most patients to handle and only those that are PDL1 showed increased benefit.  HCP shared that his take-away was that he should test for PDL1 and use pembro monotherapy for any level of PDL1 positivity by ""any IHC test"". HCP was also unaware that the majority of data presented by Merck was at 10mg/kg dose.","A regional melanoma TL shared with me that he initially started a melanoma patient on Pembro, but the patient showed no response.  He then switched the patient to the Ipi/Nivo regimen and has since started responding.  He was hesitant to use the combination upfront because of the potential of toxicity, but now he thinks that the regimen should be used upfront in otherwise healthy patients, and as salvage therapy for monotx progressers."
Medical Insights Melanoma,"monotherapy, combo, metastatic melanoma, nivolumab","RTL MD in melanoma said that if he does have a patient that either has a poor performance status or requests PD1 monotherapy, his choice is to start with nivolumab.

For this, he gives no break in treatment when he sees a lack of response but just goes right into the regimen on the next cycle with reduced dose of nivo.",A community HCP felt that single agent nivolumab would be a more appropriate choice in 1L metastatic melanoma for patients with low disease burden and the combo of ipi+nivo would be only appropriate in those melanoma patients with high burden of disease needing rapid response,"Local community TL in commenting on CM-026 results of PD1 monotherapy not being enough in 1L broad NSCLC patient population, he does feel IO-IO combo is the answer as he truly feels there needs to be something priming the immune system in addition to PD1 therapy, however he does feel ipi is far too toxic and other combos of nivo should be focused on more; TL stated that NSCLC patients are often more beaten down than melanoma patients so while he does feel there can perhaps remain a role for ipi+nivo in melanoma, another IO+nivo option will be better for NSCLC patients","Met with a regional melanoma AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI mentioned that he is part of his institutional team that is looking at developing a home-grown treatment algorithm in terms of IO treatments.

He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

The TL noted that the issue occurs when the Melanoma service elects to go to Infliximab after I.V. steroids have not been successful in controlling the AE.  The Tl stated that the Hospital has had no issues proscribing Infliximab in the out-patient setting.  The TL suggested it would far simpler to go right to Infliximab if oral steroids are not successful in managing the IrAE.  The Tl also urged BMS to get involved in helping address this issue with Insurers.,"In regard to efficacy vs safety of using regimen for 1L metastatic Melanoma treatment:  

Regional TL stated:  Steroids are being used so much faster in solid tumor inpatient treatment for AEs.  Even more than just 1 year ago.  Anyone who sees that a patient is on I/O therapy has been pulling the trigger on steroids first, asking questions second.

-This TL doesn?t believe that the difference in mOS between Nivo and Cabo is significant, and doesn?t see 21 months versus more than 2 years of survival as a determining factor when choosing a treatment option. 
-Currently, this TL believes that treatment/ sequencing decisions should be made by choosing which potential set of AEs a RCC patient is willing to endure since the AEs associated with Nivo and Cabo are so different. He concedes that oral versus IV, or physician preference of back-to-back TKIs versus sandwiching Nivo between 2 TKIs also play a role in choosing a treatment option.
-The TL did mention that if Nivo is able to reproduce in RCC the long OS tail seen in melanoma, then Nivo will be the standard in 2L and Cabo would be relegated to 3L."

- pace of progression (20% of pts exhibiting faster progression prefers TKI) 
- toxicity of 1L VEGF TKI (if had minimal tox/dose reduction, more likely to give cabo 2L due to convience of oral dosing)
- compliance to taking oral meds and reporting of side effects
- Performance status (lower PS would always get nivo)","GU TL shared his treatment-decision algorithm in RCC:
1L - VEGF TKI (currently pazopanib, but though CABO-SUN looked goog)

Does not expect this to change dramatically with entry of cabo, however stated that cab will now be his preferred 2L/3L TKI instead of axitinib that he currently uses.  He would consider  levantnib+everolimus following cabo as believes value in adding a mTOR.  While TL believes that OS endpt trumps all, that especially for older patients, PFS endpoint is also very meaningful.","At an academic Grand Rounds, TL shared from podium that he was confident that nivo would remain clear 2L SOC for RCC even with cabozatanib demonstrating a significant OS benefit due to durability and favorable tox.

Stated that when he has just stopped the 1L TKI, he often sees a 'bounce back effect with increased pace of progression that can just be too much for nivo to catch up to'.  Stated that RCC patients tend to 'gradually' stop responding to TKI so you can still get months of 'slowed pace' even after progression, making it ideal situation to give IO time to work.

However, if the primary grows rapidly, or if there are more than 2 new lesions then that is most likely true progression and it is unlikely that continuing IO therapy will sway the balance.","GU RTL states that while he prefers to give nivolumab 2L in RCC patients, that he uses cabozatanib in patients who are progressing ""fast"" as he is concerned that IO works too slowly.  When asked to elaborate on his definition of 'fast progressors' he stated that it is at most 25% of patients and that he can often tell speed of progression by clinical appearances (PS, pain, fatigue) rather than scans.  

He stated that even in 'moderate pace' progressors, that at least 50% of the patients have their disease 'explode' once they come off of their 1L TKI, sometimes to the point he has no choice by to put them back on.  He had considered 'bridging' in nivolumab while weaning off the TKI but was concerned about safety.  Reactively reviewed TKI+nivo safety data from 209-017 and he thought that this was very acceptable and that he may begin to do this.","Based on the median time to response and higher number of 'late' responses in 025, coupled with the overall slower progression of RCC patients, TL is considering doing first scan at 12 weeks rather than 8-9 weeks as he think it may better reflect the benefit without showing as much pseudoprogression.","GU TL shared his treatment-decision algorithm in RCC:

As nivolumab has a broad approval in RCC, he does not anticipate payers asking for PD-L1 tests nor denying claims for lack of prior testing.",Regional TL commented that she is not that interested in IO+TKI combinations for 1L RCC. TL believes that dosing of both agents will have to be compromised when combined. Nivo+Ipi is a better approach in the 1L setting.,"A clinical pharmacist at an academic medical center in the Northeast US indicated that they have added PD-L1 testing (IHC) to their usual battery of genetic tests for all tumors, including NSCLC and RCC.  At present, PD-L1 levels are not being used to make treatment decisions at this center.  But she implied that more granular instructions on the use of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents are expected in future from both regulatory agencies and payers.  This center wants to have all the procedures established before these changes become mandatory requirements.","Opportunity to meet with 5 physicians at large suburban Chicago practice.  Several insights gained during discussions held as part of being there for a lunch presentation:

* Physician indicated he would not use Regimen for patients due to increased toxicities.  Discussed data for PFS and ORR in 067.  Also shared experience in early recognition and management of IMARs.  He then proceeded to say it was really due to patient's PS that he went with monotherapy.  His colleague overheard conversation and stated he would use Regimen for his eligible patients due to the better efficacy profile.  Same physician thought Nivo was a Pfizer agent - corrected misconception.

* Physician unaware of 2L approval in RCC - data shared

*Physician unaware of 2L approval in non-squamous NSCLC, data shared.  Same physician stated he hadn't seen much benefit in using Nivo, but also stated he has treated several squamous histology patients.  Noted he is also treating a small cell patient off label with Nivo

*Physician stated he didn't know how we (especially me as a clinician) could be positive about our IO agents due to their extraordinary costs and drain on the economy.  Allowed physician to verbalize his frustrations and shared the importance of all parties coming to the table to try and provide best quality care for all patients while being economically responsible

* Physician questioned use of Infliximab for diarrhea/colitis.  Stated he knew a physician colleague who had a patient in hospital on an IO agent with severe diarrhea.  Reviewed algorithms, use of consultative services and importance of early recognition and management of IMARs

* Physician shared he would see Opdivo as good 2L option for patients with met RCC, currently has 2 patients on treatment (with RCC)

* Physician commented on latest approval in cHL and states this will be a very limited patient population based on the approved indication","When asked about PD-L1 test, an RTL from the New England area informed me ""that they just started testing all of there NSCLC pts for PD-L1, but for RCC pts, there are not testing at all""."
Medical Insights RCC,"discussed, shared, GU, academic","All GU treating TLs at academic cancer center (including RCC NCCN panelist) met to develop institutional RCC treatment algorithm (so practice decisions are standardized across all providers). Evaluated all RCC asco data. For 2L have decided to keep Nivo as SOC (even though the cabo and lenvantinib is good, all would prefer to give a patient an IO agent sooner than later). 
There were key populations that were discussed as exceptions: 
1) bone met population (initially were thinking cabo but as increasing Nivo data in that population have decided Nivo in that group) 
2) Those with autoimmune disease will most likely receive a TKI, until additional data with Nivo
3) Those with non-clear cell histology will be decided in a case by case, sarcomatoid will most likely get Nivo but others are debated until -374 data is available.","Large community RTL who sees most of practices GU patients (but also treats other tumor types) expressed cautious optimism around ipi+nivo data in RCC (016 ESMO).  He states that 'any improvement is great but toxicity is still a concern' but that he doesn't feel that ipi is the ""right dance partner"" for nivo in GU tumors. At this point, TL would most like to see data on PD1+IDO for RCC.  

TL is not very excited for IO+TKI combos as he feels that the toxicity is going to be a 1+1 = 10, however we did discuss the NCI nivo+cabo Apolo data and he was 'pleasantly surprised'.","Large community RTL who sees most of practices GU patients (but also treats other tumor types) shared that while he is universally using nivolumab for all of his 2L RCC (n~6) patients (primarily due to toxicity profile vs. TKIs) he has seen very responses and even SD seems to be limited in duration. Has been overall disappointed.  TL notes that he has actually had 'amazing' resulting in the NSCLC and melanoma patients he has treated, so his expectations were very high for RCC.","A regional GU TL at an NCI designated cancer center expressed that he was eagerly awaiting the results of CaboSun and -214.  He said that if CaboSun is positive, he will definitely treat his first line RCC patients with cabozantinib; but he would be amenable to Nivo plus Ipi if it was just as good as cabo.","Community LTL of a large practice shared that they are routinely using Foundation One with each patient to provide a personalized medicine approach. Even though PD-L1 testing is available, they do not use the results for treatment decisions and would never consider it relevant for RCC."
Medical Insights RCC,"treats, combination, cabozantinib, sunitinib",An academic GU TL does not use cabozantinib or lenvatinib/everolimus combo in 2L mRCC. This TL prefers Nivolumab because of its efficacy and safety profile.,A RCC TL when discussing the RCC treatment landscape does not feel that the approval of cabozantinib or the approval of lenvatinib plus everolimus will have any impact on how he currently is treating his patients.  Both will be reserved for later lines of therapy.,Academic TL shared that he is not that excited about the Eisai trial investigating lenvatinib/everolimus or lenvatinib/pembrolizumab vs sunitinib alone in 1L aRCC. It's another TKI study...unsure if they will participate.,"Thomas Hudson DO (Texas A&M, US Oncology/McKesson) discussed the challenge of sequencing TKI therapies and IO agents in kidney cancers.  He indicated that cabozantinib might replace sunitinib in first line therapy for clear cell RCC, if the final results reflect the improvement in PFS already released by a press release from Exelixis.  However, he was dismissive of either of the new TKIs (cabozantinib and lenvatinib) as second line therapy in RCC.  His patients are well educated and are demanding IO therapy.  In addition, there is no data to indicate superiority for TKIs over nivolumab in this setting.  The next generation TKIs will be relegated to third line therapy after IO failure.","David McDermott MD (BIDMC Boston) an expert on melanoma and RCC, and a leading clinical trials leader discussed the safety issues in using checkpoint inhibitors in patients with autoimmune disorders.  He made a cautious endorsement, pointing out the range of possible results with ipilimumab (Johnson DB, Jama Oncol. 2016).  Despite being treated with immune modulatory therapy to treat immune-mediated AEs, many patients maintained the response of ipilimumab, including one complete response.  He also presented one of his cases, a patient with metastatic melanoma and psoriatic arthritis who was treated with pembrolizumab.  When the psoriatic arthritis flared, the patient was treated with apremilast (a PDE4 inhibitor) without compromising efficacy of pembrolizumab.  He also presented the data from Weber (2015) publication in JCO, to point out that immunosuppressants does not appear to affect the efficacy of nivolumab either."
