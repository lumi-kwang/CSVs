""Newly-approved immunotherapy drugs for cancer have contributed to growing revenue at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as more patients visit the hospital for access to the life-saving treatments.

""The hospital?s net patient service revenue skyrocketed in the second quarter, according to financials released last week. For the first two quarters ending March 31, the hospital reported net patient service revenue of $441.4 million, a 23 percent increase from the two quarters the year prior.

""Hospital spokesman John Noble said the uptick is mainly because of two new immunotherapy drugs approved by the FDA toward the end of 2015 ? one for the treatment of lung and renal cell cancer called Opdivo, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and one, called Keytruda and sold by Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) for the treatment of melanoma...""

""The hospital also saw an increase in volume, which contributed to higher patient revenue. According to financials, the hospital saw a 3,216 patient uptick in infusion visits to 76,647, and a 2,634 patient uptick to 38,201 clinic visits...""

""Though the patient revenue contributed to a 17 percent increase in operating revenue to $682.4 million, the high cost of the pharmacy drugs contributed to an uptick in expenses, with operating expenses increasing 17 percent to $655 million.

""The hospital still reported impressive year-over-year gains in operating income, seeing a 20 percent increase to $27.3 million compared to the same period the year prior.""","GHNW Onc Pharmacy lead informed that mixed dosing approach -wt. based up to 80Kg; 240mg beyond -(background- Insight entered 11/9/2016) will result in significant net savings to health plan.

A single price increase by BMS/Pfizer could wipe out much or all of the rebate value for a plan over the course of a contract If they select your  product, while they can be assured that the decision to prefer the other products would make sure a plan can?t go too far astray during the life of the contract for competitors offering PP.","Oncology Clinical Pharmacist at Beth Israel Deaconness Hospital in Boston stated that he believes that if A-Z's PD-1 product is approved in December it could lead to IDNs choosing 1 preferred agent if it enters the market at a reduced price.  He said it would be difficult if an IDN chose one product and a payer chose another product as their preferred agent, if that happened.","Per the DBM:
""Apparently, Genetech is currently providing a discount with several large community privately owned accounts across the nation, as well as a rebate similar to ours.  What they offer is as follows:

1)	1% rebate through McKesson (similar to our contract) for all infusible products (Tecentriq was included in this when approved for bladder cancer).
2)	In addition to the 1% rebate for all customers, for the large community private accounts, they are also offering an upfront discount of 4.3% + ASP.  It is not performance based (no growth or volume component) and is adjusted quarterly based on ASP.  This discount may be also occurring through McKesson, but not entirely sure if this is how it is executed or goes directly to the account.

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms
?	Doesn?t want one bad experience to tarnish an oncologist?s perception of regimen","The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?","National lung TL volunteered the following when asked by a audience member during an iplan about whether the 026 results mean physicians shouldn't treat PDL1- patients with nivo: he said ""No, this doesn't mean you shouldn't treat PDL1- patients"". He said remember that there is still about a 10% ORR in the PDL1- folks and the durability of responses in those patients is as good as in the PDL1+.",148

Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system

o	PDL1 expression highly dynamic
o	Cutpoint selection issues
o	Assay variability (not yet harmonized)
o	Patient and tumor heterogeneitiy
o	Or just bad luck

a.	AI disclosed membership on the Head and Neck NCCN panel and is also the chair for the upcoming updates.
b.	AI shared some unsolicited insights on the topic of how NCCN committees in general consider and review guidelines and updates.  AI says that although the consent and approval of all panelists is sought, the process for doing that can be rather informal, depending on the specific chair of the committee.  For example, review/consent/approval may be done through email communication.","a national/regional lung AI and NCCN NSCLC Panelist provided the following insights from the podium at a lung CME event.

?	CM 017 (SQ NSCLC)
?	Field should be moving from focusing on median improvement of PFS/OS to focusing on evaluating for the tail of the curve (as sign of on-going response)
?	Showed CM 017, urged to focus on tail of the curve.  Showed percentage of patients who had prolonged on-going duration of response, in responders
?	In regards to CM 057
o	Showed PDL1 expression demographics of patients
o	Said mDOR of 17.2 months with Nivo versus 5months with Docetaxel  is incredible, compared to OS seen with chemo treatments.  
?	Emphasized this as impressive
o	He said some doctors say Nivo is good choice even in non-expressors, considering its much more tolerable AE profile, and perhaps should be SOC.
?	In regards to CM 057, highlighted ~9% response in non-expressors
o	Said this is as good a response as docetaxel (response rate), with a better AE profile
?	PDL1 expression is affected by where in the tumor you acquire tissue to do the PDL1 analysis
?	He described a patient who has been off treatment for 2.5 y, and has had no clinical signs of progression to this day (got PD1 inhibitor starting in 2/12).
?	In regards to CM 012,?
o	In melanoma, this regimen much more toxic
o	In lung, CM 012, have not seen this toxicity
?	In regards to KN 024,?
o	Small trial for today?s standards (n=305)
o	PDL1 greater than 50%
o	Did allow for cross-over, keep in mind when think about data that is public.

- 2 NTL and 2 RTL mentioned that had BMS selected a different PDL-1 cut-off the 026 trial may have been positive, perception is NOT that nivo is less effective than pembro from the 026 read-out
-  2 RTLs have stated that PFS may not have been the best endpoint and are waiting for OS readout
-  1 community TL and 2 academic TLs stated that they currently have patients who are asking for 1L monotherapy pembro based on the 024 press release, some patients are willing to pay out of pocket for treatment vs enrolling in clinical trials
-  1 RTL was less optimistic stating ?you shot yourselves in the foot by selecting a 5% cut-point and endpoint of PFS?.  Combo therapy (ipi+nivo) will have to demonstrate ?cure? or high % of CR to compete against monotherapy pembro in + expressers based on a more favorable toxicity profile
-  Consensus from academic to community TLs stating that they see pem and nivo as being the same and the Q3week is the key advantage that pembro has despite the differences in trial design because they now have a better understanding of MOA, activity, and safety in a collection of trials across nivo and pembro",A NTL who was SITC stated that they feel that the decrease TRAE rate with N1I3 in bladder on the -032 study as compared to melanoma is due to the bladder patients on -032  having had prior chemotherapy.  The NTL feels that the prior chemo dampens the immune response so the combination is less toxic.  The NTL feels that there will likely be higher TRAE rates in the frontline setting.,1021

In study CM-012, very impressive results were observed with nivo+ipi regimen in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of ?1% and ?5%, but cohorts were very small.

 KN-021 was a small phase II study. The high response rate, short time to response, improved PFS, and good safety profile observed in the pembro+CT arm are encouraging, but there was no OS benefit with this combination regimen. OS and safety results are extremely immature. Phase 1b study GP28328 of atezo+CT combination therapy has provided quite impressive results, but it included < 20 patients per group.

cost,Segmentation,  Clinical Practice Influencers,3.08589133881,2.41326554639e-05,103,168,"Met with a nationally recognized TL/AI NCCN lung panelist who shared the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.","Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)",Numerous TLs are not happy about the flat dose for NSCLC patients as they state the majority of their population is under the 80kg mean seen in the BMS clinical trials. The main concerns surround safety and the increase in cost. Most would have preferred the label to have weight based dosing remain as an option for underweight patients.,271

The topic was discussion of whether PDL1 testing is clinically relevant for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
o	Checkpoint inhibition is relevant biologically
o	Sophisticated pre-clinical testing in animal models demonstrated biologic relevance
o	PDL1+ expressers demonstrate higher response in many different cancers
?	057 KM curves by PDL1 show higher response for higher expressers
?	017 not same, but different beast
?	012 shows higher response in higher expressors
o	the problem is not PDL1 (a good test), it?s Pharma that has confused with different cuts of data, etc.
o	PDL1 (life cycle of PDL1 as biomarker), PDL1 testing validated in 1st and 2L NSCLC

Versus not.","The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?","?	How are panelists thinking about the first-line lung space?
?	1L story is set
?	Testing will help to select those pts likely to respond up front

?	PD-L1(-) pts 
?	I would never offer up front mono-therapy in these patients
?	If patient presents with EGRF or ALK mutations, I would not give them up front PD-1 monotherapy
o	Traditional treatment is indicated here; combo therapy could challenge this
o	Unmet need still exists for the non-smoking population 
?	Verdict is still out on testing with combo
?	1L phase III trial ? should bring clarity to this question
o	Discussed high rate of PD-L1 screen failures for 1L Atezo study in his patients. Interested in whether geographic region has implications on PD-L1 expression (are there more high PD-L1 expressors in tobacco regions?)
o	Thoughts around IO sequencing with chemo, IO combined with chemo, IO monotherapy, and/or IO combination therapy
?	Combo regimens will require major educational efforts especially at the community setting
?	Input on the ASCO presentation on CM-012 
o	Strengths/limitations/gaps in the data/next steps in 1L space
?	I do worry about combos, and not necessarily only ipi/nivo but the combos in general
?	In particular, toxicities associated and general lack of knowledge in how to manage them; more education on safety management needed ? consider including management algorithms in publications
?	Despite favoring responses in the Ipi q12w arm, Q6w makes sense to move forward with due to imbalance of arms 
?	Issues: How do we explain ?Stable? disease?
?	This is a phenomenon that we are seeing with many patients and from a patient standpoinTime to next treatment?
?	Might be useful
o	Also consider highlighting duration of response

?	Input on 2L NSCLC 
?	Felt the story for monotherapy in 2L NSCLC is clear and solid
?	CI
o	?With the Merck announcement, testing up front will become standard?
o	I don?t believe you guys are going to get an FDA label in ?all comers; the label will specify cutoffs studied in the trials? 
?	?That?s where Merck has you beat; they already have their tests in central labs; you need to get your test in there prior to publication?

+++CM-227+++
?	Indicated that CM-227 might be BMS last chance in lung.
*       Since enrollment is nearly complete would not change anything (e.g., adding a new cohort would not be scientifically sound). 
*       Concerned about cohorts with PDL1 <1% (concerns only partially alleviated by review of CM-012 latest results).","During a proactive meeting to discuss CM-026 data, a member of the NCCN Board of Directors and Executive Director of a large regional cancer center made the following comments:
+++New NCCN guidelines+++
?	At first wondered if there might be a role for PD1 inhibitors in 1L NSLCL for patients with PDL1 5%-to-50%. However was sensitive to the arguments that: 1) there is no data with pembro in 1L for PDL1<50%NSCLC; 2) no parallel should be made between exploratory results of CM-057 in patients with <1% PDL1 - a trial that met its primary endpoint - and results of CM-026 ? a negative study not designed as a non-inferiority trial.","During a proactive meeting to discuss CM-026 data, a member of the NCCN Board of Directors and Executive Director of a large regional cancer center made the following comments:
+++CM-024+++
?	Knew only what had been published in the press release and the ESMO abstract. Was shocked to see that CM-024 had missed all of its endpoints.
?	 Suggested that the following factors probably contributed to the negative results: inclusion of very low PDL1 expressors and low power resulting in major imbalances between groups. 
?	Commented that the PFS KM curves were baffling. Asked if pseudoprogressions in the nivo arm might have played a role (noted that pseudoprogressions seem to be rarer with NSCLC than melanoma, but first follow-up assessment in CM-026 took place early at 6 wks).
?	Suggested that nivo had shown no clinical activity in CM-026. After being reminded that PFS, OS, and ORR were similar in both study arms, agreed that it was more appropriate to conclude that nivo had an efficacy similar to that of CT in PDL1 ?5% NSCLC, with a better safety profile.",60

During a brief discussion about concordance of PD-L1 expression levels across tests, initially stated that evidence thus far indicates that all tests are equivalent; then agreed that SP142 is fundamentally different from the other tests.

?	For 1L, further explained that Keytruda will become SOC for patients with tumor PDL1 expression ?50% (PL-based CT still best option for patients with PDL1 expression <50%).
?	For 2L, and when asked ?why Tecentriq??, explained that nivo, pembro, and atezo are all equivalent. Rationale for giving preference to Tecentriq: 1) more experience with the agent (his institution has contributed to multiple atezo trials); 2) convenience of q3w for the patients (unnecessary to see patients more frequently than q3w to ensure optimal safety; insensitive to the argument that median number of doses is similar with q2w and q3w for a majority of patients given median duration of treatment of ~3mo). ?I also love nivo, but I have no reason to use it?. ?In 2L pembro is at the bottom of the list?

cost,Segmentation,  Economic/Value Influencers,9.69230769231,9.51081501821e-06,103,168,"Met with a nationally recognized TL/AI NCCN lung panelist who shared the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.","Elizabeth Blanchard MD (President, MSCO) discussed her views on alternate payment models that are currently being piloted in oncology care.

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.

The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed.

Though he was not interested in discussing the 026 results in detail, he commented that potential positive signals would have been masked by the very low PD-L1 cutoff for enrollment.  Commenting on Keynote 024 results, he felt that the positive results from this trial will likely strengthen the case for pembrolizumab in second-line use.  In their institution-specific pathway, they are already using pembrolizumab as their preferred agent for PD-L1 positive patients, with a cutoff of PD-L1>1%.  Upon being challenged by the HSL for the rationale for this low cut off for pembrolizumab in second line, he pointed to Keynote 10 data where patients with PD-L1>1% did better than docetaxel.  This AI and his institution gives high weightage to q3w dosing, discounting factors such as PD-L1 cutoff levels and differences between squamous/non-squamous histologies.","A leading medical oncologist at an NCCN institution in New England reiterated his preference for Opdivo in second line NSCLC, in spite of the results from CheckMate 026.  According to him, the different results from CheckMate 026 and Keynote 024 do not arise from a difference in efficacy, but due to the variations in clinical trial designs and PD-L1 cutoffs.  He considers himself one of the leading prescribers of Opdivo in the country, not from his new starts but from the prolonged responses in his patients.  He believes that Keytruda in the first line will be limited to a tiny slice of the population, as there are few patients who are PD-L1>50%, EGRF/ALK wild type and has an adequate performance status.","A leading kidney cancer specialist from an NCCN institution in the Northeast commented that no oncologist in his institution tests for PD-L1 levels before initiating anti-PD1 therapy in RCC.  This is also true of his colleagues nationally.  He does not see the logic in testing for PD-L1 levels to choose between a new TKI and immuno-oncology agents.

o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",750

Vice Chancellor Clin Res at an academic institution shared the following unsolicited insights during a reactive discussion about ESMO 2016 data:
?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",289

Accepts cytology and FNA samples without any disclaimer; believes that as long as there are 100 tumor cells, it's on label.

Personally receives 3-4 requests for PD-L1 testing per month, mostly for 22C3, and sends these to NeoGenomics. Has no intention of bringing this testing in-house due to low volume but has both Ventana and Dako platforms available for use. Believes that NeoGenomics will sometimes just stain the slide and send it back without scoring so that he can score it himself. For cases that are borderline for 22C3 (40-50%), he will ask for other opinions instead of just calling negative.","?	The institution has thus far been sending out to BioGenomics for PD-L1 testing, but is now validating 22C3 in-house due to large volume of requests (950 requests institution-wide since March 2016, mostly 22C3)

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.

Surprised at and impressed by how big the magnitude of benefit was in KN024.

-  2 RTLs have stated that PFS may not have been the best endpoint and are waiting for OS readout
-  1 community TL and 2 academic TLs stated that they currently have patients who are asking for 1L monotherapy pembro based on the 024 press release, some patients are willing to pay out of pocket for treatment vs enrolling in clinical trials
-  1 RTL was less optimistic stating ?you shot yourselves in the foot by selecting a 5% cut-point and endpoint of PFS?.  Combo therapy (ipi+nivo) will have to demonstrate ?cure? or high % of CR to compete against monotherapy pembro in + expressers based on a more favorable toxicity profile
-  Consensus from academic to community TLs stating that they see pem and nivo as being the same and the Q3week is the key advantage that pembro has despite the differences in trial design because they now have a better understanding of MOA, activity, and safety in a collection of trials across nivo and pembro",Lung RTL shared that despite 026 not meeting primary endpoint with 5% PDL-1 cut-off she would consider using nivo if the PFS is similar to chemotherapy in higher expressers given nivo's safety profile.,931

On OAK at ESMO he stated he and the panel viewed the data to be good, roughly like Opdivo.  On the issue of the ESMO data showing ""positive"" results in the PDL-1 negative population, we went over the issues and he stated the panel recently discussed this.  Stated there was not strong enthusiasm of panel for the PDL-1 negative argument due to reasons we discussed internally, but also due to low numbers and at this point unpublished data (he stressed this).  That said given indication of atezo unlikely to get NCCN recommendation more restrictive than label.

Agreed with just about everybody else that 026 was surprise, likely trial design, etc.

On KN 021 stated panel felt the data way to early to recommend Chemo/Pembro in any way.  Had no opinion on whether IO/IO or IO/chemo likely to be superior

Stated NCCN was working on recommendation on how to use PDL-1 cutoffs in some future statement.  This is second NCCN panelist to mention this to me.  Other was in cHL.  Stated majority of effort was in the 1-100% area (as opposed to 0-3+)  Commended BMS for working with Ventana

He was excited to hear that pembro was superior for both PFS and OS. He is awaiting the data, but stated that he would follow the -024 design and use pembro 1L only in patients with >50% PD-L1 expression. His use of PD-1 inhibitors 1L will be data driven; does not plan to utilize haphazardly.","I met with NCCN panelist in NSCLC  He shared the following

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it?s attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial.","TL stated that last in-person meeting was 1-2 months ago.  Stated there is a call coming up in 1-2 weeks.  On the topic of PDL-1 cutoffs in first line, he stated that pembro would definitely not get a rating until the data was published.  On the possibility this would happen in the near future, he stated that he was somewhat new to panel, but his impression was that the NSCLC panel tried to be more ?inclusive? than ?exclusive?.   On the 50% cut-off issue he stated there could be different possibilities.  He mention there could be a certain recommendation but also some sort of footnote or comment.  It was difficult to tell if this was a general PDL-1 positive listing for pembro with a footnote stating the trial was 50% or greater, or if there could be a listing using a 50% cut-off with a footnote stating a wider range of patients may be appropriate.
 
In other notes he agreed with many that a cut-off is good but we don?t know what it is yet.  Someplace between 5 and 50.  Stated he was heavily involved in adjuvant trials but not metastatic disease.  Inquired as to whether 026 would include results at varying degrees of expression (answered affirmatively).",931

Believes there is a great need to do thorough sequencing studies to figure out where the best place for each treatment option truly is.","Local TL commented that he feels we may be jumping the gun trying to replace platinum doublet therapy as a 1L standard for NSCLC. He believe the role of immunotherapy may be better suited to work after chemotherapy due to the increased antigen presentation, etc, along with the fact that relegating chemo for later line will be more difficult to give once pts have already failed a 1L treatment. The best chance at getting a good response to doublet therapy will likely be in the 1L and the role for I/O may be better in the maintenance or 2L setting due to it's superior tox profile.","NTL in midwest stated at her institution they generally push trials, especially after first line.

-	Patient with uveal melanoma.  Minor /short duration response to Pembro.  Progressed quickly on targeted therapy clinical trial, responding well for 3+ months to Regimen
-	Patient with melanoma.  Progressed on anti-PD-L1 trial, stable disease for a few months with Pembro, progressed on BRAF/Mek, good response to Regimen
-	Service has tried Regimen after progression on Pembro as first line therapy in about 5 patients.  TL believes they have seen objective responses in 2 patients.",708

TL said that the data from Hodi's ASCO'16 poster from CM-069 will be helpful in educating colleagues that steroid used to treat irAE's don't diminish the tumor response to Ipi+Nivo Regimen.
However, TL said that similar data for Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC would be even more impactful. The perception of irAE's on Nivo are less severe than when on Regimen. So physicians may still want to shorten the steroid treatment on Nivo monotherapy, unless they're shown that there's no reason to do so.","NP at a community hospital reported continued ""difficulty convincing some of my doctor colleagues to initiate steroids appropriately"".

With basically all NSCLC patients receiving PD1 monotherapy at some point in their treatment plan, there will be a huge unmet need for effective treatments post-PD1.  This NTL, who is an investigator on several studies with IO+IO combinations, voiced opinion (based on her experience) that Ipi+Nivo seems to be the only IO+IO combo that can resurrect a response in patients who have failed PD1 monotherapy.  4-1BB, anti-KIR, OX40 etc do not seem to have this activity.

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

The LTL shared that by having this information, for PD-L1+ pts, both Pembro and Nivo would be good options with high ORR in the 2nd line setting, and if the pt was PD-L1 negative then opdivo (only) would still be an ""ok"" option.","An LTL/RTL stated/suggested that his plan for 2nd line NSCLC is to start nivolumab while waiting for PL-L1 test expression.  If the PD-L1 test comes back at 50%+ positive, he would switch the pt to Keytruda (view the data stronger as this sub-population was specifically studied by Merck).  If the test comes back between 1-49%, he said that it's a 50/50 choice between Opdivo/Keytruda and it would be up to the pts on q2w drug or q3w drug.

Although data from KEYNOTE-024 shows an importance for the PD-L1 expression, he's NOT likely to have everyone test for PD-L1, wait for results, then go to pembro if they are very high expressors.  Because of this hassle, LTL is very hesitant to implement PD-L1 expression into clinical practice without seeing results from 227.

LTL is just fine with chemo x4 cycles, then go straight to nivo and bypass PD-L1 testing.","[026 - Top 300] LTL from a large community institution mentioned that the data from 026 does NOT impact his current use of nivolumab in second line, especially since 026 had such a high crossover rate.

LTL mentioned that chemo still has its place in the front-line setting: pem/carbo for non-squamous and gem/cis for squamous.

TL said that the data from Hodi's ASCO'16 poster from CM-069 will be helpful in educating colleagues that steroid used to treat irAE's don't diminish the tumor response to Ipi+Nivo Regimen.
However, TL said that similar data for Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC would be even more impactful. The perception of irAE's on Nivo are less severe than when on Regimen. So physicians may still want to shorten the steroid treatment on Nivo monotherapy, unless they're shown that there's no reason to do so.","NP at a community hospital reported continued ""difficulty convincing some of my doctor colleagues to initiate steroids appropriately"".

This NTL, who is an investigator on several studies with IO+IO combinations, voiced opinion (based on her experience) that Ipi+Nivo seems to be the only IO+IO combo that can resurrect a response in patients who have failed PD1 monotherapy.  4-1BB, anti-KIR, OX40 etc do not seem to have this activity.

The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.",750

?	For 2L, and when asked ?why Tecentriq??, explained that nivo, pembro, and atezo are all equivalent. Rationale for giving preference to Tecentriq: 1) more experience with the agent (his institution has contributed to multiple atezo trials); 2) convenience of q3w for the patients (unnecessary to see patients more frequently than q3w to ensure optimal safety; insensitive to the argument that median number of doses is similar with q2w and q3w for a majority of patients given median duration of treatment of ~3mo). ?I also love nivo, but I have no reason to use it?. ?In 2L pembro is at the bottom of the list?

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

2)	Regimen 
a.	Presented data from -069 and -067 showing the PFS curve stating ?you don?t need statistics to tell the difference in the curve favoring regimen?. 
b.	Toxicity is a concern and for older pts he chooses single agent PD1

The level of evidence for Nivo is far more robust with phase 3 data and the tolerability is much better, so he?ll choose Nivo over TKIs.","1.	Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.

NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",23

1)	We have 10y OS data with Yervoy and this will probably be even longer with Regimen.  Pts don?t want a response ?they want to be on the tail in of the curve?.  He stated with Regimen and other IO combinations that ?hopefully we?ll be talking to pts about a 30y OS plan in the future?
2)	Regimen 
a.	Presented data from -069 and -067 showing the PFS curve stating ?you don?t need statistics to tell the difference in the curve favoring regimen?. 
b.	Toxicity is a concern and for older pts he chooses single agent PD1
c.	Regimen demonstrates similar activity in PDL1- pts
d.	TL stated uses Regimen every day in the clinic and has seen some spectacular results.  It?s an ?excellent Regimen?.  Very potent regimen
3)	Stated the immune response is very rapid with PD1 agents and especially regimen
4)	PDL1 as biomarker:
a.	PDL1+ pts tend to have better responses across tumor types
b.	Showed Nivo OS curves in PDL+/- pts and stated most of the advantage is in PDL1+ pts.  However, he stated you ?don?t want to withhold nivolumab treatment based on PDL1 expression levels bc PDL1- pts can have significant benefit as well?
c.	He stated mutational load may be the best biomarker
d.	Pts with high levels of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment and invasive margins tend to have better responses
e.	No T cells within in tumor microenvironment pts don?t seem to respond as well and this is an area ?we as researchers need to improve T cell recruitment with novel combinations of injectables/vaccines (referenced TVEC)
5)	Need to identify agents that have activity in checkpoint resistant pts ? TL has had success with adoptive T cell transfer with approximately 30% RR although the RR drops in checkpoint resistant pts from 50% (checkpoint naïve) to about 30%.","RCC NTL mentioned the differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that may influence response to Nivo.

We were discussing the MSKCC intermediate and poor risk subgroup analysis.

2) ?Non-inflamed tumor phenotype? ? immune cells are not found within the TME (Immune Cell Free Zone).  He attributes this to the immunosuppressive nature of tumor cells suppressing chemokines/cytokines production that recruits the T cells into the microenvironment.  He said these pts tend to have less of a response to Nivo and novel strategies need to be employed to recruit T cells into the TME such as combinations with vaccines, anti-angiogenic agents, etc.",23

TLs have also referenced the findings of Spranger et al. (Nature reference below) who investigated the gene-expression profiles of 266 cutaneous melanomas and divided them into inflamed and non-inflamed cohorts. They found that ?-catenin signaling was active in the non-inflamed cohort and an increased CTNNB1 (?-catenin) score was predictive for a lack of T-cell infiltration.  Reconstitution with Flt3 ligand dendritic cells reversed resistance to immunotherapy (anti-CTLA + anti-PD1). The WNT/?-catenin pathway may contribute to immune evasion in other tumor entities beyond melanoma and may represent one mechanism of primary resistance to immunotherapy.  This was investigated in ASCO 2016 abstract 8565 SCLC and similar trend was observed of increased ?-catenin signaling in non-inflamed phenotype and lack of t cell infiltration.  Two additional presentations mentioned were biomarkers in immunotherapy and inflammation as next checkpoint.

However, if the primary grows rapidly, or if there are more than 2 new lesions then that is most likely true progression and it is unlikely that continuing IO therapy will sway the balance.",A National Lung TL stated that she thinks that Chemotherapy plus IO therapy is a mistake.  The tails of the OS curves will minimize 1L IO therapy because basically you are giving chemo to patients that don't need it.  So when those patients come off treatment because of the toxicities (likely from the chemo) you have lost the benefit of the IO therapy.,"A National Thought Leader (and NCCN member) stated that she feels community treaters of NSCLC with IO therapy are not experienced enough to treat appropriately.  She stated she has patients that show up to her that are 6 months past NSCLC diagnosis and have gone through sometimes 2 IO agents (used one PD1 fail, try other PD1).  

She says that she does not think community treaters wait long enough for IO agents to work and are too quick to call a treatment ""a failure"" and aren't providing the patients immune system with enough time to actually mount a response.

Too often they are associating a decrease in performance status, or more often, AEs with no tumors shrinkage seen within the first 3-6 weeks as an IO failure when that may not be the case.",90

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.

-	Happy to see that ?we now have a very clear offer for very specific patient population (RE: PDL1 > 50%)?
-	Shared that panelist would NOT recommend the use of pembro for patients who are below the 50% expression level
-	Raised the question about the need ?re-test? patients in 2L even if they were tested in 1L. Her rational was to be also more selective in 2L and not to use agents who have no approval / no data for low PDL1 expression. This comment was more about pembro in 2L.  
-	Asked what data we was recently presented in lung cancer with nivo
o	Was not aware of small cell lung cancer 032 data. Asked for data through medical information

o	An admin sends out the proposed guidelines for comment from the rest of the panelists via email. AI stated the ?very loud? panelists typically get their way. He stated the PD-1?s have been sent out for review and ?you will be happy with the outcome.?
?	When asked what data is needed for an NCCN update, he stated heavier weight is given for FDA approvals; however, phase II or better data will be reviewed. He stated there was not a standard endpoint required for a given category rating (ie OS for category 1).

AI,Territory, IA,7.74160206718,5.1473269505e-07,121,70,"AI at an NCCN center in the south provided the following unsolicited insights with regards to CM026

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.  He mentioned Nivo impacted both treatment groups as the mOS for chemo due to crossover and single agent Nivo are better than historical controls.","Biomarkers: AI stated if their health system is using Pembro in 1L in expression levels >50%  based on the KN 024 data, they will use the Pembro PDL1 assay. (Blueprint discussed in which the AI is on the peer-review panel)

The health system will not re-test PDL1 expression in 2L based on Nivo data (testing not required). AI stated that obtaining enough tissue will be an issue if using more than 1 assay.","Via pathway AI stated the following from the podium at a small GPO conference.
?	While on stage, he spoke highly of Nivo. He pointed out the HR 0.59 for 017. He then showed the Pembro data and stated the HR ?isn?t as dramatic? as the nivo data. He emphasized the low number of patients enrolled (vs total screened) for the KN024 trial and stated it was highly selected pt pop. He continuously reminded the audience of >50% expressers pt pop in KN-024.  He highlighted that BMS did the right trials (017/057) and showed the KM curves. He spoke briefly on atezo
?	When speaking on CM 026, he stressed and differentiated the broad pt population (vs KN024). He stressed that a single agent is clearly performing as well as a doublet and you don?t need a statistician to see that from the curves.  He stated that even though the trial was not powered to show non-inferiority, it was clear to him the drugs performed the same.",191

He then proceeded to say it was really due to patient's PS that he went with monotherapy.  His colleague overheard conversation and stated he would use Regimen for his eligible patients due to the better efficacy profile.  Same physician thought Nivo was a Pfizer agent - corrected misconception.

* Physician unaware of 2L approval in RCC - data shared

*Physician unaware of 2L approval in non-squamous NSCLC, data shared.  Same physician stated he hadn't seen much benefit in using Nivo, but also stated he has treated several squamous histology patients.  Noted he is also treating a small cell patient off label with Nivo

*Physician stated he didn't know how we (especially me as a clinician) could be positive about our IO agents due to their extraordinary costs and drain on the economy.  Allowed physician to verbalize his frustrations and shared the importance of all parties coming to the table to try and provide best quality care for all patients while being economically responsible

* Physician questioned use of Infliximab for diarrhea/colitis.  Stated he knew a physician colleague who had a patient in hospital on an IO agent with severe diarrhea.  Reviewed algorithms, use of consultative services and importance of early recognition and management of IMARs

* Physician shared he would see Opdivo as good 2L option for patients with met RCC, currently has 2 patients on treatment (with RCC)

* Physician commented on latest approval in cHL and states this will be a very limited patient population based on the approved indication",487

Due to this, in RCC, he very commonly adds nivolumab to a TKI (typically sunitinib or axitinib) if a patient is beginning to progress rather than switch trx completely.

- pace of progression (20% of pts exhibiting faster progression prefers TKI) 
- toxicity of 1L VEGF TKI (if had minimal tox/dose reduction, more likely to give cabo 2L due to convience of oral dosing)
- compliance to taking oral meds and reporting of side effects
- Performance status (lower PS would always get nivo)",10

Surprised at and impressed by how big the magnitude of benefit was in KN024.

Thinks that this is likely ?a fluke?, but given the magnitude of benefit in 024 doesn?t think that small difference in patient populations could make data from ?super positive? to ?solidly negative? between trials so ?could be a real difference?.

The panelist considers the efficacy in OS to be better than what is seen in clinical practice with single agent therapies (methotrexate, cetuximab, docetaxel etc.).  He has a very negative opinion on the efficacy and toxicity of these standard of care therapies.  

Combination therapies will enhance the potential of immune-oncology in difficult to treat cancers and advanced stage disease.  Robust data needs to be developed for all options with Opdivo such as IO combinations, IO + targeted therapies and IO + chemotherapy/RT.  He also stressed the need to do clinical trials in nasopharyngeal SCCHN due to its unique etiology and response to treatment.  He does not endorse extending the NCCN recommendations to include this population based on data from other types of SCCHN.","The Director of Hematologic Malignancies at a major academic hospital in Boston downplayed the incidence of GVHD in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation after receiving nivolumab previously.  Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced disease in later lines of treatment are more susceptible to GVHD after allogeneic SCT generally, even without previous exposure to nivolumab.  As careful management of GVHD can reduce allo-associated mortality, nivolumab provides a good therapeutic option in advanced HL patients.",36

He lamented the lack of options for patients once the disease progresses with metastasis primarily to the liver.  Systemic chemotherapy and targeted agents have produce very low response rates and does little to improve overall survival in these patients.

Most of their patients on nivolumab in off-label indications in this Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) currently receive free medication through the patient assistance program.  This hospital is now attempting to move some of these patients to their insurance plan, to reduce the burden on the assistance program.","The NCCN Guidelines panelist (ophthalmology/medical oncology) for melanoma from a major New England academic hospital highlighted the variability in ocular adverse events associated with immuno-oncology therapies.  The majority of the patients continue IO therapy with intense management of ocular adverse events.  But in the most extreme cases, adverse reactions can progress from perfect vision to complete non-responsiveness to light within 48 hours.  Factors that increase the risk of ocular AEs are currently unknown.  

Less serious AEs are managed with topical corticosteroids, while serious AEs warrant withholding IO therapy and treating with IV corticosteroids, particularly when the optic nerve is involved.  Cyclosporine and artificial tears are used to manage dry eyes associated with IO agents.  As the AEs can worsen very quickly, both ophthalmologists and medical oncologists should identify and treat them without delay, as well as educate patients proactively on the symptoms.  This NCCN panelist also stressed the need to train community and academic oncologists as well as ophthalmologists to identify the symptoms of ocular IMARs, given the propensity of these AEs to worsen very quickly.",551

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.

PDL-1,Territory," MID-WEST
IL",17.0,3.38005688888e-10,50,881,"I met with NCCN panelist in NSCLC  He shared the following

He stated the NSCLC panel met recently.  He stated that Merck will get a first line listing for pembro in the greater than 50% staining population

Stated panel was surprised by 026 data.  Stated he felt that PFS was a poor choice for primary endpoint.

NCCN is working on a ?guideline? for PDL-1 testing in first line as it was becoming very important.  At this point it will involve only tumor staining.  It will not include the Roche method of including tumor infiltrating cells.  Stated the guideline will have a number cut-off, i.e. ~1-100%....Roche?s 0-3+ method will not be part of guideline.  Stated there would be some recommendation for pathologists who use Roche assay to convert the Roche result to a 0-100% scale.

Panel not impressed with atezo data

Stated that while  ipi/nivo data impressive in NSCLC the panel laughed a bit at it?s attention as the data was so early.  That said he felt there was great potential here

Stated he heard Merck was fairly far along with ipi/pembro data.  More so in melanoma but also lung

Stated he heard AZ combo data will likely come out shortly after BMS combo data in first line NSCLC

On the subject of likely CMSTO 2016 presentation of 026.  He stated if we had OS data that was positive at a particular cut-off there would be a good chance BMS could get a NCCN listing in first line consistent with that given 026 was a large phase 3 trial.","TL stated that last in-person meeting was 1-2 months ago.  Stated there is a call coming up in 1-2 weeks.  On the topic of PDL-1 cutoffs in first line, he stated that pembro would definitely not get a rating until the data was published.  On the possibility this would happen in the near future, he stated that he was somewhat new to panel, but his impression was that the NSCLC panel tried to be more ?inclusive? than ?exclusive?.   On the 50% cut-off issue he stated there could be different possibilities.  He mention there could be a certain recommendation but also some sort of footnote or comment.  It was difficult to tell if this was a general PDL-1 positive listing for pembro with a footnote stating the trial was 50% or greater, or if there could be a listing using a 50% cut-off with a footnote stating a wider range of patients may be appropriate.
 
In other notes he agreed with many that a cut-off is good but we don?t know what it is yet.  Someplace between 5 and 50.  Stated he was heavily involved in adjuvant trials but not metastatic disease.  Inquired as to whether 026 would include results at varying degrees of expression (answered affirmatively).","I met with NCCN panelist for SCLC (though sees mostly NSCLC) at an NCCN center in  midwest.  She offered these insights:

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

On the design of 026 she felt that BMS probably had good advice given to us at ad boards when designing trial but we did not listen (she did not expand on this)

She stated that her institution just started testing for PDL-1 in house.  Prior it took 2-3 weeks for results.  Now takes 2 days",931

Further, he stated that if BMS had OS data that was positive in 026 at a different cut-off, purely for example say 25%, that BMS would get positive rec at 25%, Merck at 50%.

It specifically would be addressing the issue of early identification, safety standards, and treatment protocols.

They have the expected adverse effect issues of peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia.  He stated that PD1 inhibitors would play a critical role in patients who traditionally have exhausted all therapies.  There is a strong clinical rationale to move up IO agents to earlier lines of therapy.,"I met with an oncologist specializing in lung at a university hospital in south/Midwest.  He shared a number of interesting insights.  They centered on a theme or two and I will try and tie them together here:

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.  He mentioned he was swayed by a conversation he had with Roy Herbst a while back.  His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

We discussed second line and he felt it was unfair to compare Nivo (and pembro I assume) to Doce in second line?Stated now the other standard in second line is docetaxel and Ramucirumab",87

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.  He mentioned Nivo impacted both treatment groups as the mOS for chemo due to crossover and single agent Nivo are better than historical controls.","Biomarkers: AI stated if their health system is using Pembro in 1L in expression levels >50%  based on the KN 024 data, they will use the Pembro PDL1 assay.

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.

N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships

N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed.

-  Consensus from academic to community TLs stating that they see pem and nivo as being the same and the Q3week is the key advantage that pembro has despite the differences in trial design because they now have a better understanding of MOA, activity, and safety in a collection of trials across nivo and pembro",Lung RTL shared that despite 026 not meeting primary endpoint with 5% PDL-1 cut-off she would consider using nivo if the PFS is similar to chemotherapy in higher expressers given nivo's safety profile.,931

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.

In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.

?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.

?	AI reactively mentioned that she?s observed instances of use of PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) as salvage therapy, in her institution, with unimpressive results.  
?	Due to the fact that her institution is not an IDN, comparative costs associated with IO therapy alternatives (eg. AE management costs associated with traditional Chemo) are not as important to them since they may generate revenue for interventions such as ER visits instead of being as sensitive to total spend for a patient.  
?	Due to this perspective, value measures such as the impact of seeing improved OS or positive impacts on quality of life are more important to her type of institution.  
?	She shared her institution?s P&T process as the following.  A physician (eg. Oncologist) requests an addition of a medication to formulary, which initiates pharmacy to create and present a drug monograph for P&T consideration.  With this info, the P&T committee then votes on this request for addition to formulary.  
?	The AI?s institution does have a formulary, but oncologists can order medicines not on formulary without a prior authorization process.  
?	If the medicine is on formulary, ease of access is faster since the medication is likely to be stocked by the infusion pharmacy.","Met with a regional oncology P&T Formulary AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

?	This algorithm would take into account patient specific factors, such as patient?s performance status, and also baseline labs.  
?	It would define an algorithm in terms of class of agents, such as PD1 inhibitors, instead of be product specific.
?	AI currently does not test for PDL1 status prior to treatment initiation.
?	AI mentioned that he still considers individual patient specific characteristics in deciding whether to start on Nivo monotherapy versus regimen, such as performance status.
?	AI defines current practice in terms of nivolumab as 60% of patients getting monotherapy and 40% getting regimen.
?	He describes some anecdotal experience of seeing patients respond to regimen after not seeing a response on initial Pembro treatment.  He quantified that 1 out of 5 patients, he might see this type of occurrence.
?	When issue of cost arose, was able to reinforce with AI that the cost of regimen is only incrementally more expensive, around 6%, higher than the cost of sequential ipi followed by nivo.  
?	Reinforced with AI that the true cost of regimen treatment needs to take into account that 57% of patients in 069 received median number of doses (the full combo portion of treatment) and that only around 14% of patients were treated for 1 year.

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.

He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).

But in the most extreme cases, adverse reactions can progress from perfect vision to complete non-responsiveness to light within 48 hours.  Factors that increase the risk of ocular AEs are currently unknown.  

Less serious AEs are managed with topical corticosteroids, while serious AEs warrant withholding IO therapy and treating with IV corticosteroids, particularly when the optic nerve is involved.  Cyclosporine and artificial tears are used to manage dry eyes associated with IO agents.  As the AEs can worsen very quickly, both ophthalmologists and medical oncologists should identify and treat them without delay, as well as educate patients proactively on the symptoms.  This NCCN panelist also stressed the need to train community and academic oncologists as well as ophthalmologists to identify the symptoms of ocular IMARs, given the propensity of these AEs to worsen very quickly.",551

He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.

?	A discussion around the discussant?s (Soria) comments/tweets at ESMO when he compared the trials (we confirmed that you can?t compare data across trials, but can look at differences in trials)
o	Differences in trial designs (CM026/KN 024)  and imbalances were discussed (never smokers, PDL1 expression differences, non-stratified PDL1 expression, cross over rates, females, health of pt pop). We discussed that Soria stated only ~10-15% of the patients in the real world would match the patient population in KN 024. 
?	This led to the question of why BMS designed their trial this way. She stated she is accustomed to BMS having stronger trials. 
?	Panelist confirmed that females do better in her experience
?	Panelist is aware of ICER, but is not participating in the review. 
?	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS? stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she?s heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She?s unsure how they will get paid. She agreed with BMS request to not be in the guidelines as their institution and BMS align in their EBM thinking.
?	AI stated the biggest unmet need for patients with 1L lung cancer is to provide an effective therapy with minimal toxicity to patients with poor PS. She stated that?s were I/O can really show it?s benefit. 012 and 227 design were reactively discussed. She?s excited about 227. 
?	She stated there?s a big education gap on the side of the patient. She feels patients are still trying to push through their IMAR. 
?	AI stated she orders both the Pembro/Nivo assays when doing PDL1 expression testing. Discussion on FDA blue print ensued. She stated, in her experience, patients rarely test for >50%. 
?	She brought up OAK being an all comers population. She didn?t comment further, and only stated, we?ll have to see if the FDA gives them an indication.

-	Was aware of CM026 and KN024 studies? outcomes. Overall insights very consistent with previous insighths communicated (RE: differences in patient population 026/024, imbalance between the 2 arms in 026)
-	Happy to see that ?we now have a very clear offer for very specific patient population (RE: PDL1 > 50%)?
-	Shared that panelist would NOT recommend the use of pembro for patients who are below the 50% expression level
-	Raised the question about the need ?re-test? patients in 2L even if they were tested in 1L. Her rational was to be also more selective in 2L and not to use agents who have no approval / no data for low PDL1 expression. This comment was more about pembro in 2L.

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.  He mentioned Nivo impacted both treatment groups as the mOS for chemo due to crossover and single agent Nivo are better than historical controls.","Biomarkers: AI stated if their health system is using Pembro in 1L in expression levels >50%  based on the KN 024 data, they will use the Pembro PDL1 assay. (Blueprint discussed in which the AI is on the peer-review panel)

The health system will not re-test PDL1 expression in 2L based on Nivo data (testing not required). AI stated that obtaining enough tissue will be an issue if using more than 1 assay.","Via pathway AI stated the following from the podium at a small GPO conference.
?	While on stage, he spoke highly of Nivo. He pointed out the HR 0.59 for 017. He then showed the Pembro data and stated the HR ?isn?t as dramatic? as the nivo data. He emphasized the low number of patients enrolled (vs total screened) for the KN024 trial and stated it was highly selected pt pop. He continuously reminded the audience of >50% expressers pt pop in KN-024.  He highlighted that BMS did the right trials (017/057) and showed the KM curves. He spoke briefly on atezo
?	When speaking on CM 026, he stressed and differentiated the broad pt population (vs KN024). He stressed that a single agent is clearly performing as well as a doublet and you don?t need a statistician to see that from the curves.

NYC",94.8125,1.66797583263e-05,8,109,"Heather Copher-Sweeney and I recently met with a NTL/ Lymphoma NCCN panelist from an NCI-designated academic institution to discuss the role of I-O in the treatment of cHL. The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance","During a recent meeting with a lung cancer AI, the topic of PD-1 inhibitors in 1L was addressed in the context of CM-026 and KN-024. 
This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.",117

    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).","A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value

KN-024:
The biggest discrepancy among the AI/ TLs was in the % of patients that KN-024 addresses:
-AI/ TL #1: 30-35%
-AI/ TL #2: closer to 20% (after excluding EGFR and ALK patients) ? just slightly more than the percentage of patients with EGFR mutation
-Remainder thought the number was between 25-30%
Rescanning:
-AI/ TL#3: Q6W for Pembro in 1L (~ to chemo rescanning)
-AI/ TL #2: Q9W for Pembro in 1L, then begin to decrease frequency
KN-021:
-AI/ TL #4: doesn?t believe that this will be adopted. There doesn?t seem to be an OS benefit, so why would PFS benefit matter
-AI/ TL #1: unconvinced that Pembro + chemo provides any tangible additional benefit",130

NYC",39.5052083333,9.47002339709e-07,28,243,"Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)","Ann Saylors and I met with a NTL/ former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave the position to a junior RadOnc faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center in the Southeast region who volunteered these insights regarding the implications of the BMS NSCLC and SCLC data presented at ASCO:

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms

-best guess as to why KN-024 met its primary endpoint and CM-026 did not was because -026 wasn?t able to select the right patient population. He continued that BMS? biomarker strategy has yet to be defined, whereas Merck knows exactly the type of patients to target.
-biggest question is whether testing should be reflex (all patients) or oncology-driven. The downside to reflex testing is the expense and that it would be pathologist-driven, who won?t have relevant patient information, including cancer staging","During a recent meeting with a lung cancer AI, the topic of PD-1 inhibitors in 1L was addressed in the context of CM-026 and KN-024. 
This AI leaves open the possibility of changing opinion once data is shared at ESMO, but believes that in the 28% of NSCLC patients that express PD-L1 >50%, testing and use of Pembro in 1L will surpass chemotherapy.
However, the biggest concern is whether oncologists will make the mistake of equating PD-L1 positive expression with PD-L1 >50% and just give Pembro to all PD-L1 positive patients. To this AI, the CM-026 study proved that use of PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy will not benefit all PD-L1 positive patients in 1L, and although not its intended purpose, this BMS study magnified the importance of cutoffs.
This AI was also surprised that more attention wasn?t given to an ASCO poster showing that in patients given a PD-1 inhibitor who developed pneumonitis, treated, and then re-challenged with a PD-1 inhibitor, 60% would re-develop pneumonitis.","During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from 5 NCCN panelists or NTLs regarding the evolving NSCLC management landscape, with particular focus on KN-024, CM-026, and PD-L1 testing.
Unanimous that even without cross-trial comparison, Nivo, Pembro, and Atezo have comparable efficacy in 2L.
?	When asked how to decide which of  the 3 checkpoint inhibitors to use in 2L:
-AI/ TL #1: no real differences and you?re going to use the drug ?you grew up with??those like him that participated in Nivo trials will likely stick with Nivo because of familiarity
-AI/ TL #2: no testing and most convenient
1) doesn?t need more paperwork and will avoid filling out forms to test, which eliminates Pembro from consideration
2) Q3W > Q2W, so will use Atezo over Nivo
-AI/ TL #3: PD-1s ORR generally better than PD-L1s ORR, even though comparable OS",229

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.

?	AI expressed frustration that the one test they can perform in-house is the Ventana (Atezo) assay, for which they recently bought a machine.  We reviewed the FDA blueprint analysis that showed the Ventana assay as highly discordant with BMS/Merck assays and how this could lead to misclassification of some PDL1 expressers as non-expressers due to lack of sensitivity, which he admitted to understanding.","BMS Attendees: Cynthia Chan (MSL), Tony Wang (HSL)

?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.

?	AI reactively mentioned that she?s observed instances of use of PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) as salvage therapy, in her institution, with unimpressive results.  
?	Due to the fact that her institution is not an IDN, comparative costs associated with IO therapy alternatives (eg. AE management costs associated with traditional Chemo) are not as important to them since they may generate revenue for interventions such as ER visits instead of being as sensitive to total spend for a patient.  
?	Due to this perspective, value measures such as the impact of seeing improved OS or positive impacts on quality of life are more important to her type of institution.  
?	She shared her institution?s P&T process as the following.  A physician (eg. Oncologist) requests an addition of a medication to formulary, which initiates pharmacy to create and present a drug monograph for P&T consideration.  With this info, the P&T committee then votes on this request for addition to formulary.  
?	The AI?s institution does have a formulary, but oncologists can order medicines not on formulary without a prior authorization process.  
?	If the medicine is on formulary, ease of access is faster since the medication is likely to be stocked by the infusion pharmacy.","Met with a regional oncology P&T Formulary AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.

?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.

?	AI says such a deck/information, targeted towards non-medical or non-subject matter experts, would be very valuable to justify the value of IO agents due to durability of response, even if efficacy endpoints such as PFS are not much greater than control groups, if OS benefit is seen. 
?	AI questioned in Lung studies why there are no major trials studying Ipi alone against the backdrop of 032 where high percentages of the patients were PDL1 non-expressors.  Responded to AI that BMS commitment is to follow the science and is committed to trying different IO combinations in different tumors, due to the responses seen with IO combinations in melanoma.",6

In this way, Merck provides opportunities for patients to receive promising new therapies locally, by making available local clinical trial sites for patients in need that cannot travel to the US to participate in a clinical trial. It also gives local oncologists familiarity and confidence using Keytruda based on the experience they acquire when performing clinical trials. In contrast, he does not see BMS actively performing Opdivo clinical trials in Puerto Rico.","A Regional TL clinical trials PI with academic affiliation at a VA hospital commented that he has not used Keytruda since Opdivo can be used without testing for PD-L1. He discussed with his hema/onco fellows the possibility of using chemo instead of Opdivo in PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients since, even though OS was numerically higher in the Opdivo arm, no statistically significant difference in OS was found between treatment arms. Nevertheless they concluded that, worst case scenario, Opdivo is still as effective as chemo in this population but with a better safety profile. Therefore, Opdivo is clearly the best option for NSCLC patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression. In his opinion Opdivo is very well tolerated by patients, much better than chemo. Commented that it is like ""administering water"".","A TL with academic affiliation commented that he believed the previous Opdivo + Yervoy Regimen approval for BRAF wild type only could change current clinical practice since before the Regimen approval oncologists in PR usually started patients on Yervoy first-line irrespective of BRAF status. Most even started treatment without knowing the BRAF status. But with the previous Regimen approval based on 069, the oncologists had to perform BRAF testing to determine if the patient was eligible for treatment. In case the patient was BRAF mutant, the oncologists had to consider the option of prescribing a BRAF or BRAF+MEK combo since the Regimen was not FDA approved for mutant patients. Now with this new approval irrespective of BRAF status, he believes this is no longer an issue and most PR oncologists will keep selecting immunotherapy as their first-line choice irrespective of mutation status.",470

Therefor the NCCN Guidelines are unlikely to change it language to include all anti-angiogenic therapies.  However, oncologists should have no concern in using targeted therapies patients previously treated with bevacizumab.","Thomas Hudson DO (Texas A&M, US Oncology/McKesson) discussed the challenge of sequencing TKI therapies and IO agents in kidney cancers.  He indicated that cabozantinib might replace sunitinib in first line therapy for clear cell RCC, if the final results reflect the improvement in PFS already released by a press release from Exelixis.  However, he was dismissive of either of the new TKIs (cabozantinib and lenvatinib) as second line therapy in RCC.  His patients are well educated and are demanding IO therapy.  In addition, there is no data to indicate superiority for TKIs over nivolumab in this setting.  The next generation TKIs will be relegated to third line therapy after IO failure.",164

This is a No-Access site, so there is no opportunity for me to educate those physicians.
TL said that the data from Hodi's ASCO'16 poster from CM-069 will be helpful in educating colleagues that steroid used to treat irAE's don't diminish the tumor response to Ipi+Nivo Regimen.
However, TL said that similar data for Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC would be even more impactful. The perception of irAE's on Nivo are less severe than when on Regimen. So physicians may still want to shorten the steroid treatment on Nivo monotherapy, unless they're shown that there's no reason to do so.","NP at a community hospital reported continued ""difficulty convincing some of my doctor colleagues to initiate steroids appropriately"".

?	AI expressed frustration that the one test they can perform in-house is the Ventana (Atezo) assay, for which they recently bought a machine.  We reviewed the FDA blueprint analysis that showed the Ventana assay as highly discordant with BMS/Merck assays and how this could lead to misclassification of some PDL1 expressers as non-expressers due to lack of sensitivity, which he admitted to understanding.","Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.

?	She will make comment to panel again supporting this distinction of recommendations based upon level of evidence, for future recommendations, as the panel has done here.","Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests.","Met with a regional AI/TL melanoma NCCN panelist, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI disclosed that he also treats Head and Neck cancer in his practice and is the chair of the Head and Neck department at his institution.  
?	In regards to NCCN H&N guidelines, he expressed that the phase of a study, for example phase 3 versus phase 1, should lead to a distinction in level of evidence, although not a great distinction since he believes Nivo and Pembro are not that different agents.
o	For example in the head and neck context, he said Keytruda should receive a category 2A recommendation due to phase 1 studies while Nivo should receive perhaps a category 1 due to phase 3 studies.  
?	In regards to melanoma, reactively shared ASCO CM 069 (Hodi) subset analysis comparing PFS/OS in patients who discontinued regimen as being similar to the general randomized population on regimen.  
o	He shared that he was not surprised, as he?s seen examples of on-going responses in his melanoma patients who have discontinued regimen due to AE?s.",19
consideration,Territory, WA,38.5054945055,2.32208627364e-12,18,0,"Met with a regional oncology pharmacist manager AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI reactively mentioned that she?s observed instances of use of PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) as salvage therapy, in her institution, with unimpressive results.  
?	Due to the fact that her institution is not an IDN, comparative costs associated with IO therapy alternatives (eg. AE management costs associated with traditional Chemo) are not as important to them since they may generate revenue for interventions such as ER visits instead of being as sensitive to total spend for a patient.  
?	Due to this perspective, value measures such as the impact of seeing improved OS or positive impacts on quality of life are more important to her type of institution.  
?	She shared her institution?s P&T process as the following.  A physician (eg. Oncologist) requests an addition of a medication to formulary, which initiates pharmacy to create and present a drug monograph for P&T consideration.  With this info, the P&T committee then votes on this request for addition to formulary.  
?	The AI?s institution does have a formulary, but oncologists can order medicines not on formulary without a prior authorization process.  
?	If the medicine is on formulary, ease of access is faster since the medication is likely to be stocked by the infusion pharmacy.","Met with a regional oncology P&T Formulary AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI was impressed with the ORR of Nivo in cHL of 65%, noting that he expected the Independent Radiologic review ORR to be reduced from the prior Investigator assessed ORR, which made sense.
?	AI was familiar with 032 data presented at ASCO and expressed excitement at the 032 efficacy in SCLC, given that this is an unmet need given lack of current treatment options
?	AI was excited at the 141 OS rate/mOS and commented that OS advantage is what should be the overriding consideration in formulary considerations, which is what we have with the 141 data. 
?	He discounted the lack of PFS advantage in 141, repeating the sentiment above.","Met with a regional melanoma AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI mentioned that he is part of his institutional team that is looking at developing a home-grown treatment algorithm in terms of IO treatments.
?	This algorithm would take into account patient specific factors, such as patient?s performance status, and also baseline labs.  
?	It would define an algorithm in terms of class of agents, such as PD1 inhibitors, instead of be product specific.
?	AI currently does not test for PDL1 status prior to treatment initiation.
?	AI mentioned that he still considers individual patient specific characteristics in deciding whether to start on Nivo monotherapy versus regimen, such as performance status.
?	AI defines current practice in terms of nivolumab as 60% of patients getting monotherapy and 40% getting regimen.
?	He describes some anecdotal experience of seeing patients respond to regimen after not seeing a response on initial Pembro treatment.  He quantified that 1 out of 5 patients, he might see this type of occurrence.
?	When issue of cost arose, was able to reinforce with AI that the cost of regimen is only incrementally more expensive, around 6%, higher than the cost of sequential ipi followed by nivo.  
?	Reinforced with AI that the true cost of regimen treatment needs to take into account that 57% of patients in 069 received median number of doses (the full combo portion of treatment) and that only around 14% of patients were treated for 1 year.  
?	Broadened AI?s consideration of true cost parameters, as evidenced by his agreement that this needs to be considered in terms of true cost of regimen.  
?	In response to his question about sequential therapy, shared that nivo followed by ipi, as well as the reverse sequential regimens, did not show as good efficacy or more favorable AE profile compared to regimen.  
?	AI referenced his institution?s goal of conducting outcomes studies, in melanoma and beyond.  Offered connecting AI with BMS HEOR colleague to explore potential collaboration.
?	AI expressed that he was not particularly wowed with any melanoma data shared at ASCO 2016, as they were mostly comprised of updates on previously published studies.",18

Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

KN 024,Territory, WA,28.0769230769,9.12811855951e-10,17,248,"Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.","Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.
o	He referenced the above discussed imbalances in patient population and the lack of stratification of subgroups as possible explanations of the negative result, along with possibly bad luck.
o	He said that we need to hold off judgment until the combo data is available.","Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
