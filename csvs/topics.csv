"[SCCHN, TL told, GU] 08-14-2016","A Lung SCCHN TL told me that he has already been visited by Merck and that since they don't have a need for PD-L1 testing and the ORR between Nivo and Pembro look similar, he will likely use Pembro for most patients even after Nivo gains approval in SCCHN.  He likes that we have a RCT and OS survival but at this time not enough to just use Nivo"
[10-28-2016,"At an international GI conference, NTL said, CRC] 10-28-2016 At an international GI conference, a NTL said, about advances in immunotherapy in CRC: We continue to pursue immunotherapy because although conventional therapies push survival curves to the right, IO pushes it up ORR about 16% with nivolumab. Interestingly, the responses were across the board and were durable. In GI cancers, there are nice and deep responses with MMR deficiency.  Responses are durable and pt are ready for treatment holiday after 2 years of therapy with maintained response."
"[tissue, mutational load, status] 03-25-2016","The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.   Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane. Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice. Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment. Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions. 
Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2 Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?"
"[requests, perform, lab] 12-12-2016",A Lung NTL told me that he has heard the Foundation is using the Ventana SP142 antibody to fulfill requests for some of its PD-1 testing results.  The TL is aware of the Project Blueprint data and does not believe this test should be used.  The TL noted that this might hurt Merck since the SP142 test seems to read consistently lower than the Dako tests and could turn >50% staining to less than and thus out of label for Pembro.  TL went on to say this might effect BMS also since some physicians have been reserving Opdivo for patients with PD-L1 negative tests and Atezolizumab with its q3w dosing might be desirable.
"[reduce, wastage, cost] 12-01-2016","Met with the drug information department of a key national/regional institution AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI reactively shared that her institution conducted some internal analysis comparing the cost of Nivo and Pembro.  
?	We reviewed the HEOR data comparing Nivo and Pembro showing the trend of less wastage with Nivo compared to Pembro and potential savings across a range of patient weights due to the vial disposition.  
?	She shared that due to the reduced wastage with Nivo use, with the availability of 40mg and 100mg vials, and the fact that Pembro only comes in 100mg vials, Nivo came out as more cost effective due to the reduced wastage in their analysis."
"[label, insurance, compassionate use] 12-05-2016",RTL shared that thus far when using pembro in the 1L NSCLC setting for patients < 50% PDL1 expression they have met no resistance in having it covered by insurance; TL feels that the insurance company only really looking for 1L data in general and the specifics to PDL1 status aren't necessary (so far) in reimbursement
"[patient population, difference, CM 026] 11-18-2016","Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights: ?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.
?	His institution is wanting to narrow available PD1 agents in their pathways and will be sitting down to evaluate the 2L lung space as well."
"[mentioned, poster, SCLC] 08-24-2016","Met with a regional drug use management and pathway implementation AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights. ?	He says they are still in contracting for past year with VIA, which has not been finalized.  
?	At this point in time, VIA pathway not yet implemented for his organization, but he has access to the VIA ?sandbox? so he is able to access the system and has knowledge of pathways for tumor types.
?	In regards to SCLC, he reactively disclosed that the pathway has been updated recently after the update of the NCCN guidelines (inclusion of regimen as option in 2L).
?	AI said that Nivo is on pathway for NSCLC.  If a patient does not have a PDL1 test, it?s unknown, or the test shows a low or non-expressor, then Nivo is the choice.  
?	The pathway asks if a NSCLC patient has a positive PDL1 test, without referring to specific PDL1 thresholds.  If it?s positive, then Keytruda is offered.  If it?s negative, Opdivo is offered.  
?	He mentioned that VIA pathway adherence goal is 80% for his organization (didn?t specific whether this is target across tumors or is goal for each tumor type).
?	He says VIA pathway is provider centric, which is useful in community practices, and less useful in a academic setting where providers are more familiar with SOC and understand the data. 
?	AI said that the VIA pathway adherence also has a patient choice component, such as a preference for orals over infusible medicines.  He said this is not fully incorporated into the system yet."
"[prefer, 2nd line, agents] 12-07-2016","A regional TL stated that while he thinks most of the PD-1/PD-L1 agents are going to be equivalent in terms of efficacy across the different tumor types, he would prefer to use Opdivo for everything. He has the most experience with Opdivo and thinks that consistency with dosing and safety management would help reduce errors in their practice."
"[chemo, chemotherapy, Ipi+Nivo] 11-10-2016","Local community TL in commenting on CM-026 results of PD1 monotherapy not being enough in 1L broad NSCLC patient population, he does feel IO-IO combo is the answer as he truly feels there needs to be something priming the immune system in addition to PD1 therapy, however he does feel ipi is far too toxic and other combos of nivo should be focused on more; TL stated that NSCLC patients are often more beaten down than melanoma patients so while he does feel there can perhaps remain a role for ipi+nivo in melanoma, another IO+nivo option will be better for NSCLC patients"
"[ie, space, histology] 03-01-2016","Nurses at a large gathering for ONS dinner in Oregon, interested in comments regarding chemo precautions for infusion nurses and pharmacy staff in relation to historic uses of chemotherapy drugs and precautions. Article in ONS magazine regarding importance of implementing safety in administration of cancer agents triggered discussion. Nurse liaison retorted with the importance of safety precautions with mixing or administering Opdivo and Yervoy products and discussed potential for long term effects for patients (ie pregnancy precautions). Nurses volunteered they are reforming their current SOP's and practices in efforts to protect nurses, and provide specific guidance for pregnant nurses administering cancer agents."
"[Nivo monotherapy, ipi/nivo combo, expectations] 06-12-2016","Onc shared full understanding of 1st line implication and is impressed with data released at ASCO with ipi/nivo combo. Doc quoted the exact dosing for ipi/nivo including q6 or q12w dosing of ipi.  Doc mentioned best case 1st line patients get 10-12 months control with chemo, this will ""double that expectation"". Doc ""cant wait to see OS"""
"[treat patients, clinically, SD] 04-03-2016",A lung RTL from NY City volunteered that he suspects that AztraZeneca's MYSTIC trial in 1st line NSCLC may be under powered to show a significant difference in PFS versus chemotherapy.  He highlighted his own experience in 209-227 in which he has observed good objective responses in patients on either the Opdivo+Yervoy and chemotherapy arms.  The TL beleives the true benefit will show up in the durability of the clinical responses for the I-O treated patients.
"[mutations, BRAF, EGFR] 05-27-2016",A community oncologist shared that at his practice PD-L1 testing has been recently included together with testing for EGFR activating mutations and ALK translocation to the initial molecular evaluation of patients with NSQ-NSCLC.
"[concerns, adverse events, severe] 03-25-2016","The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.   Breast

"[therapy, option, RR] 04-06-2016",RTL at a large academic center is ?not sold on brentuximab maintenance therapy due to lack of OS data.?  He does not see it as an established standard of care but will talk to pts about option post transplant.  He doesn?t use brentuximab as consolidative agent at this time but use at relapse.
"[feels, TKI, potentially] 02-28-2016","1.	Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.   2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types 3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system"
"[institution, discussed, payers] 12-06-2016",Insight from molecular/lung pathologist TL (CAP/NCCN panelist) from an academic institution in NW territory: i) TL is not a fan of PD-L1 testing; ii) TL?s molecular lab has seen a recent increase in MMR/MSI testing in colorectal cancer; iii) TL described observing lack of concordance between IHC-based and molecular based MMR/MSI assays; iv) all samples are sent out to Neogenomics for PD-L1 testing but TL would like to bring PD-L1 testing in-house; v) institution only has Ventana platform but TL is not excited on SP142 antibody based IHC; vi) TL favors Ventana over Dako platforms and would like to have a reliable IHC assay on the Ventana platform; vii) TL was very interested to learn more on the Blueprint study and potentially importing SP263 clone into her lab for clinical testing as a result of this study; viii) conclusions from Blueprint study were briefly discussed with TL and link to publication was provided to TL after the meeting; ix) TL mentioned that CAP and NCCN ?near-future guidelines are under strict confidentiality? but that the requests for rolling out new guidelines have been made (in NCCN setting). Revision of guidelines is driven by requests to release new guidelines.
"[indication, drug, flat dosing] 10-13-2016","TLs state the OAK data is intriguing in that the agent works in the all comer population, has apparent efficacy in the PDL1 non-expressing population, has q3w convenience, and a highly tolerable safety profile. When questioned about how to choose between agents in the 2L the TLs in general still feel that atezo is a ""me too"" drug and that nivo has such broad indications across tumor types with proven efficacy and support for many others that there is an established loyalty to nivo. Hence, the TLs predict varied physician preference (""choose one or the other and neither are wrong"") in the 2L."
"[stated, enrollment, Spoke] 12-11-2016","Regional H/N TL commented that even with EXTREME being the SoC for 1L rec/met, she's surprised there isn't more of an option left to physicians for clinical trial settings where investigator's choice could be part of the protocol. She expressed that EXTREME is very rarely used as-is and is very challenging to sell a pt on when they know they may be randomized to this therapy. Most often 5-FU is swapped out for a taxane and occasionally cetuximab is left out altogether depending on the state of the pt. She felt this may create a lag to the ongoing I/O trials that are using this as a comparator."
