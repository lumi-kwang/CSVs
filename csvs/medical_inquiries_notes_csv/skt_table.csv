I hope you are doing well. I have a question, and I was hoping you could connect me with a medical science liaison. We have a patient who has developed AKI and we believe it is secondary to Opdivo. The nephrologist asked me to reach out to you. 1. Can you provide more guidance on the management of AKI secondary to Opdivo? What were the steroid doses used in the clinical trials? How long are the steroids continued? Were the steroids tapered? Is there a preferred steroid (Ex prednisone vs solu-medrol or IV vs PO)? 2. Are there any recommendations on the diagnostic workup to confirm the AKI is secondary to Opdivo? Thank you, Monique Garcia Aldaz, Pharm.D.

Sent: Thursday, October 06, 2016 12:10 PM To: A7 Pharmacists; Kipley, Leigh A Subject: FW: Flu Vaccines for Immuno-therapy patients Hi Leigh Ann, I don't want to answer for Astrid and she is off today. I'm sure we need to get a consensus from our docs on this. But I quickly researched and found great info on this link: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/852392#vp_2 Gary Cohen, MD, medical director of the Cancer Institute at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, and a panelist at the meeting, said that he is uncertain about the ""risk and efficacy"" of giving flu shots to patients on checkpoint inhibitors, which activate the immune system to attack cancer. Dr Cohen received an answer from Sigrun Hallmeyer, MD, a medical oncologist at Oncology Specialists SC, Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, in Park Ridge, Illinois, who was also a meeting panelist. She said that her practice team has decided that patients on nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, Merck), which are both approved immune checkpoint blockade drugs that act as programmed death (PD-1) inhibitors, can receive flu shots. However, patients on ipilimumab (Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb), which employs checkpoint blockade but works as a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, should wait 6 to 8 weeks after the last dose, she said. Ipilimumab generally has worse adverse events than nivolumab, and she and her colleagues decided to err on the side of caution. This makes the most sense to me. I will let Astrid follow up when she return tomorrow. What are ya'll doing?

The PI leads me to believe that ALL subtypes of NSCLC need EGFR/ALK testing. Recently this requirement was removed for the indication of melanoma. I am supposed to be the expert in all things related to the use of this drug. I am quite confused. I have one of my very smart doctors saying that one of the subtypes of NSCLC (squamous) does NOT require EGFR/ALK testing prior to the use of Opdivo. I really need clarification. Is it only required if the lung cancer is large-cell, or adenocarcinoma? Or is it required no matter what type of NSCLC. Thank you for your help - if someone could please email me (MSL or other) at the address below I would really appreciate it.

Due to the volume of requests we now get from PhRMA, we have set aside a day every other month for providing an audience for our PhRMA friends. This allows the company representatives to bring to us pertinent information about their products. We don't need a history or philosophy of the company, and hopefully you will have already presented to our PBM, ESI, all clinical and contractual information that might be of interest to us. This information is disseminated to us via the Formulary drug review process. The special audience we are setting up is for any significant information that you may wish to convey, e.g., outcome info, etc. It's a good time to chat about new products you have (but we still get the clinical reviews via ESI). If you have a product in the pipeline for potential release in six months, let's wait until then to discuss. Your presentation needs to be brief (max of 30 mins) and to the point. Our next PhRMA Day is Aug 19. If you are available and interested in meeting on that day, we have the following time slots available: 9:00 - 9:30 (Eastern) 9:30 - 10:00 (Eastern) 11:00 - 11:30 (Eastern) 1:00 - 1:30 (Eastern) 1:30 - 2:00 (Eastern) 3:00- 3:30 (Eastern) Please let me know what time would work best for you. We like to have your agenda, etc. prior to meeting in order to share with our internal staff (pharmacists, medical directors, med policy reps, et.al.), as the presented topic(s) might be of interest to them, and we welcome them to join the meeting if they wish. If you want to present a new drug or a new indication, please complete the attached questionnaire and return it to me at least 2 weeks prior to the meeting. We look forward to meeting with you.

The PI leads me to believe that ALL subtypes of NSCLC need EGFR/ALK testing. Recently this requirement was removed for the indication of melanoma. I am supposed to be the expert in all things related to the use of this drug. I am quite confused. I have one of my very smart doctors saying that one of the subtypes of NSCLC (squamous) does NOT require EGFR/ALK testing prior to the use of Opdivo. I really need clarification. Is it only required if the lung cancer is large-cell, or adenocarcinoma? Or is it required no matter what type of NSCLC. Thank you for your help - if someone could please email me (MSL or other) at the address below I would really appreciate it.

I would like to speak with someone who is the very most knowledgeable on what testing is required for NSCLC. Can you please forward this trail to that person? Dr. Wilfong is the highest expert we have on our iKM system. (this is our EMR) Our EMR is saying that the histology of the lung cancer matters on whether EGFR/ALK is required.

Due to the volume of requests we now get from PhRMA, we have set aside a day every other month for providing an audience for our PhRMA friends. This allows the company representatives to bring to us pertinent information about their products. We don't need a history or philosophy of the company, and hopefully you will have already presented to our PBM, ESI, all clinical and contractual information that might be of interest to us. This information is disseminated to us via the Formulary drug review process. The special audience we are setting up is for any significant information that you may wish to convey, e.g., outcome info, etc. It's a good time to chat about new products you have (but we still get the clinical reviews via ESI). If you have a product in the pipeline for potential release in six months, let's wait until then to discuss. Your presentation needs to be brief (max of 30 mins) and to the point. Our next PhRMA Day is Aug 19. If you are available and interested in meeting on that day, we have the following time slots available: 9:00 - 9:30 (Eastern) 9:30 - 10:00 (Eastern) 11:00 - 11:30 (Eastern) 1:00 - 1:30 (Eastern) 1:30 - 2:00 (Eastern) 3:00- 3:30 (Eastern) Please let me know what time would work best for you. We like to have your agenda, etc. prior to meeting in order to share with our internal staff (pharmacists, medical directors, med policy reps, et.al.), as the presented topic(s) might be of interest to them, and we welcome them to join the meeting if they wish. If you want to present a new drug or a new indication, please complete the attached questionnaire and return it to me at least 2 weeks prior to the meeting. We look forward to meeting with you.

The PI leads me to believe that ALL subtypes of NSCLC need EGFR/ALK testing. Recently this requirement was removed for the indication of melanoma. I am supposed to be the expert in all things related to the use of this drug. I am quite confused. I have one of my very smart doctors saying that one of the subtypes of NSCLC (squamous) does NOT require EGFR/ALK testing prior to the use of Opdivo. I really need clarification. Is it only required if the lung cancer is large-cell, or adenocarcinoma? Or is it required no matter what type of NSCLC. Thank you for your help - if someone could please email me (MSL or other) at the address below I would really appreciate it.

Dr. Wilfong is the highest expert we have on our iKM system. (this is our EMR) Our EMR is saying that the histology of the lung cancer matters on whether EGFR/ALK is required.

Caller said that no temperature excursion has occurred at this time (but seemed hesitant when saying this). Upon further probing, caller clarified that she is interested in things like: - whether Opdivo must be stored in the refrigertator. - at what temperature Opdivo must be stored. - and what the stability would be at room temperature (how long it could still be used). Spoke from the Nivolumab-Stability of nivolumab SRL to address her first two requests. Explained that BMS cannot recommend use of Opdivo that has not been stored in this manner. Informed her that we do, however, have a Product Loss Program which is handled on a case-by-case basis. Offered to provide her with their number for ""future"" reference and caller confirmed this would be helpful. Provided her with the 1-800-631-5244 number. Caller had no further questions. Decided to go ahead and report as AE-Y after the call ended. Even though caller said that no temp excursion had occurred, the wording of her request and tone led me to believe that an excursion was likely. JJ 08Jun2016","Transfer from Debbie @ Opdivo Support Line Name: Ms. Gladys Meyers (Pharmacy technician) Address: Meyers Drug Store 328 Dekalb Street Norristown, PA 19401 Phone: 610-233-3305 Caller has a question regarding the stability of Opdivo. She saw where it is suggested to store Opdivo in the fridge between 2-8 degrees Celsius. She would like to know if we have any additional storage/stability data for Opdivo if an excursion were to occur; more specifcally, if Opdivo were to be left at room temperature. Upon further probing, caller confirmed this is ""just for future reference purposes and no excursion has occurred."" Spoke from the Nivolumab-Stability of nivolumab SRL (first sentence). Explained that since BMS has not studied the use of Opdivo stored outside of these parameters, we cannot recommend the use of product if left out at room temperature. Explained to caller that we do not have data to support if the product would still be as safe/efficacious. No need to provide Product Loss number, since no patient is involved. Caller confirmed understanding and had no further questions. Caller was transferred to the survey. JJ 29Jun2016 Decided to report as AE-Y after the call ended (despite caller denying a patient is involved), since that is likely the reason behind her call today AND she did not provide any other insight (i.e. ""I'm working on a chart, project, etc"") to support that it would be for future reference.

Her wholesaler delivered Opdivo to her site's distribution center on Friday. The label on the box was marked ""Urgent"" to imply that it needed to be urgently refridgerated, but someone at her site mistook that to mean ""deliver to urgent care department"". As a result, the Opdivo was left out at room temperature over the weekend (2 days). Caller reported that it was pretty warm there over the weekend. She doesn't think the Opdivo should still be used, but she would like to reconfirm (as she needs to prepare Opdivo for a patient later today). Spoke from the Nivolumab-Stability of nivolumab and Opdivo PI to confirm that ""nivolumab vials must be stored in a refrigerator between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius."" Explained that since we do not have any extended stability data, BMS cannot recommend use of the product. However, the Product Loss Program may be an option. It is handled on a case-by-case basis. Provided her with their 1-800 number and offered to warm-transfer. Caller confirmed this would be helpful. Voice recording advised that their office doesn't open until 9am EST. Informed caller of this. She will give them a call back later this morning. Caller had no further questions. JJ 06Jun2016",292

EmergingMed operates a clinical trial education and referral service on behalf of various pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and advocacy groups. This phone and web based service educates patients and their caregivers about clinical research and helps patients identify appropriate clinical trials options based on their diagnosis and treatment history. We then refer patients who have matched to specific trials to trial sites in their geographic region. There is no charge for the patient or the site for this service. We have a patient interested in study NCT02658890 (Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and Preliminary Efficacy Study of BMS-986205 Administered in Combination With Nivolumab in Advanced Cancers) at the Vancouver, British Columbia site (#0002), but we see there is no specific contact information for that site. Can you provide us with the best way to contact someone concerning this specific site, and confirm that the site is recruiting? Let me know if you have any questions.

I actually emailed you right away, but misspelled the end of your email address and, obviously , it bounced right back. When you get a chance, I'd really appreciate if you can forward me some data on nivolumab in metastatic H&N cancer, so we can try and use it for our patients in the near future. I am hoping it gets the approval very soon. Thanks again!

However this has a pooled safety analysis of both the trials. Is there any way we could get the safety analysis across individual trials. Would you be able to send me the safety data separately for 17 and 57. We are doing a pooled meta-analysis and this would be very helpful. vamsi ________________________________ ________________________________ This message (including any attachments) may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.

Dear Diana, I have been referred to you as our regional MSL by Mavis at BMS customer service, to discuss some recent data we have generated with serum biomarkers (attached). Drs. Allan Lipton , Suhail M Ali and I here at PSHMC think this new serum biomarker data may have possible interesting implications in Immuno-Oncology clinical research, including nivolumab and other IO drug trials. Attached please find several recent abstracts and posters with serum biomarker data (PD-L1 (unpublished), SCFs, BCMA) we hope to discuss with you and IO directors at the SABCS meeting in San Antonio next week ? If yes, Dr. Lipton asks if a dinner discussion on Wed or Thurs evening next week at SABCS would be possible ? We would propose the possibility of measuring these circulating biomarkers in your clinical trials or Investigtor-initiated trials, and correlate with patient outcome. We would look forward to this interesting meeting if you and available IO Directors could attend ?

Caller reported he started Opdivo in August 2015 for non-small cell lung carcinoma, and he receives 240 mg once every two weeks. Caller stated, ""I sent an email to BMS about a week ago with a synopsis of the last year and a half, and they routed me to you. I've had mild itching that has been ongoing since the first Opdivo treatment. I've had no rash. I sent the email regarding symptoms possibly being inflammatory. The cardiothoracic surgeon thinks it is an inflammatory response to fibrosis. I have a PET scan every three months. I went from Stage 4 to Stage 3A in the primary lobe. The tumor that was in the trocantere region of the hip and the one that was in the T12 area both resolved. My symptom of hemoptysis stopped after one week of being on Opdivo.
