NTL1:  How do you sell a trial patient on a trial (NCT02788279), knowing that they could be placed on a study arm for Atezolizumab monotherapy? This is something that is understood to be a very expensive placebo in this setting.
NTL2: We don?t know that atezolizumab has no effect in this setting because our experience is limited and the alternatives, such as regorafenib, have a very low response rate.
NTL1:  This phase III was launched after a phase I with a response rate of less than 20% in a population of fewer than 50 patients.  It seems we are desperate for immunotherapy to work in every cancer.","At an international GI conference, three HCC NTLs had a brief discussion of PD1s:

NTL1:  We are all tempted to use pembrolizumab and jump on the bandwagon; Merck has made it very available through access support.  However, we need more data before using it when systemic therapies that have shown benefit are exhausted.
NTL2: We use PD1 inhibitors in patients that are MSI high.
NTL3: There may be rationale in MSI high patients for the use of PD1 inhibitors but data is still not conclusive and it is inappropriate to use without testing.","At an international GI conference, three NTLs had a discussion about immunotherapy in CRC:

NTL1:  Why is there a difference between single agent nivo and pembro in MSI high.  
NTL2:  Pembro study is a higher response rate but not a global study.  Both look to have very durable responses.  This could be due to different populations and there are questions about the dosing that is used for pembro.
NTL2:  There is a potential that pts with Lynch syndrome do worse but we need a better sample size to really judge.  It seems that these patients can have very late responses.
NTL2:  BMS may have more data in BRAF mutated pts in MSI CRC study but all of the pts that I have treated have responded
NTL3:   pseudoprogression real?
NTL2:  I think that there were a couple but they are not common.  Most responses are quite early.
NTL3:  I think it?s more of a myth.  Are you trying to lie to yourself and say it?s pseudoprogression to keep treating.
NTL3:  Do you think that there is potential for treating in the adjuvant setting rather than in tumor reductive setting?  
NTL2:  Melanoma data shows that there is great potential for immunotherapy in adjuvant.
NTL3:  When I see high responses across tumor types, I am now seeing that MSI testing is the most important thing.  Should we be testing for MSI in all patients?
NTL2:  It is hard to globally recommend MSI but if there is a potential for immunotherapy use, you should try.",60

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading. This can be demonstrated by examining what happens in the extreme, and hypothetical, scenario of a study population of 400 patients where PDL1 expression is distributed as follows - <1%, 100 patients; 1%-to-4.9%, 100 patients; 5%-to-49.9%, 100 patients; ?50%, 100 patients ?, and where ORR is 0% in patients with PDL1 expression <50% and 100% in patients with PDL1 expression ?50%.
PDL1 expression	<1%	1%-to-4.9%	5%-to-49.9%	?50%
N	100	100	100	100
True ORR	0%	0%	0%	100%
BMS way of presenting biomarker-response relationships
PDL1 expression	<1%	?1%	?5%	?50%
N	100	300	200	100
Patients responding	0	100	100	100
ORR reported	0%	33.3%	50%	100%
The latter representation of the data suggests that treatment is active at PDL1 expression levels of 1%-to49% when it is not.
?	BMS might have become so used to the intrinsically-biased way of presenting dose-response relationships in overlapping biomarker categories that, as a company, it misinterpreted evidence (or lack thereof) for nivo activity among NSCLC patients with low PDL1 expression, which in turns detrimentally influenced the way study CM-026 was designed. In other words, it is possible that many in the company, potentially including personnel involved in trial design, developed a tunnel vision for evaluating PDL1-outcome relationships.","The following insights were gleaned from an NCCN NSCLC panelist in the Midwest institution

atezo,Month, 11,2.65422468972,8.33309154623e-07,135,559,"Met with a national/regional lung AI/TL NSCLC NCCN panelist post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	He was disappointed with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% and asked about BMS internal perspective as to why there was no result.  We proceed to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	He thinks that Pembro, Nivo, and even Atezo are not that different agents.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, with BMS taking a chance and reaching for a broad patient population strategy, which won in 2L, but lost in 1L.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this will pass.
?	He is excited about combo treatments in the future, and believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	He is not sure whether IO-IO or IO-chemo will be more efficacious, but he leans toward IO-IO because he believes in having chemo as a separate option by itself.  Reactively reminded him of the 227 combo 1L trial, representing the commitment of BMS to combo IO-IO in lung.
?	He thinks it's good that the lay public is more aware of myopathy AE with PD1's, with the NY times article citing NEJM article, and is something that he's seen that's important to monitor for.
?	He believes that at an academic center like his, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients.  He asked whether BMS is considering less frequent dosing so discussed with AI reactively about BMS trials looking at q4w dosing, as well as q3w dosing arm in 227 (360mg q3w mono arm).  AI felt that such a strategy with less frequent dosing, such as q4wk dosing, may play a significant role in adoption of therapies.
?	He mentioned that the NCCN NSCLC panel has been busy with recent updates with Pembro and consideration of Atezo data, with emails flying around the group.","NCCN panelist advisor at an NCCN center:
When asked how the current data would change practice:
o	Most MDs will get a PDL1 test in 1L and use pembro for high expressors
o	In 2L, if >1%, some will use Pembro due to Q3 week. He stated that at academic centers, convenience is an issue as patients travel far. 
o	Atezo has been added to their formulary (to label), but they have only used it on trial","Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.
?	His institution is wanting to narrow available PD1 agents in their pathways and will be sitting down to evaluate the 2L lung space as well.",694

?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?",708

The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval).",69

At this time we discussed the ORR across all patient populations in the trial, focusing on the >1% and >5% populations, as well as the safety profile from the 012. We discussed traditional response rates with SOC agents in the first line, focusing on platinum doublet chemo, and the toxicities associated with these agents. AS he believes nivolumab to be a very safe drug in the second line, he was impressed to see the safety profile with the regimen combination, particularly discontinuation rates, being similar across the arms of the study. However, throughout the discussion he mentioned several times the fact that this is a phase 1 trial with very small numbers. At this point we discussed how the NCCN panels view data, highlighting that in the past they have considered adding agents to the guidelines based on P1 data in small patient populations.
-	Given the unmet need for these patients and the response rates/safety profiles discussed, the panelist recommended that we ensure all the NSCLC panelists are familiar with these data.

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

Other solid Tumor:
-Pancreas: stated due to hypoxic pancreas tumor micro-environment and no local tcells that single agent antiPD1 hasn?t worked so far
Prostate: Discussed ipi negative trial and that bone disease only arm did much better 
H&N: Stated Nivo is new standard of care","RTL from a large community practice questioned the difference between all the assays available and if there's any correlation between all 4.  Reactively presented the FDA blueprint project from AACR.  From here, RTL asked about OS data from both KN-010 and CheckMate 057.  RTL was surprised by the higher OS from nivo when compared at the 1% level.",Academic oncologist expresses her disappoint in the general public and Wall Street after -026 press release. She struggles to understand how wall street analysts can write about clinical trial data that do not understand and publish to the masses. She was upset that a H&N patient that she was treating off label canceled her appointment because of what she read online.,903
flat dosing,Month, 9,4.76143714442,1.31356538569e-07,71,360,"Pharmacist expressed concerns over 240 mg flat dose, expressing that she feels we are overdosing and overbilling. We discussed rationale for why this dose was chosen based on median 80 kg patient weight across multiple studies, and approximation to 3 mg/kg dosing. She said that based on chart review, a significant majority of her patients were below 80 kg. She further inquired whether she could use weight-based dosing for patients below 80 kg.","Flat-dose Opdivo (<80 kg): LTL from a community institution mentioned that if the steady-state concentration and drug exposure is the same, it seems ""pointless"" to increase the dose to 240 mg for patients <80 kg (vs. weight-based dosing) and he would be ""charging them more for the same efficacy.""  LTL mentioned that 40% of his patients are <80 kg.","Flat-dose Opdivo (>80 kg): LTL from a community institution mentioned for patients already receiving >240 mg, it would be ""a tough sell"" to those who are responding to treatment to tell them that their dose would be reduced.

FMS reactively mentioned that the efficacy in terms of steady-state concentrations were steady across various weight groups and this may actually save the patient on the cost aspect as less vials would be needed for patients >80 kg.",431
