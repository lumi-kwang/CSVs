Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

?	He expressed that he prefers to use regimen rather than monotherapy, due to the heightened efficacy.  
?	He expressed that he has encountered access hurdles when prescribing regimen for Oregon Medicare patients, while he has not encountered such hurdles for monotherapy.
?	He expressed that he has seen reluctance with community docs in initiating steroid treatment of immune AE?s, due to fear of suppressing immune system concurrently.  When community docs have reached out, he has been relaying the message that this is not the case in the stage where patients are developing immune AE?s after the initiation period and that steroids can be effectively used to manage immune AE?s when they occur.

2)	Regimen 
a.	Presented data from -069 and -067 showing the PFS curve stating ?you don?t need statistics to tell the difference in the curve favoring regimen?.

c.	He stated mutational load may be the best biomarker
d.	Pts with high levels of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment and invasive margins tend to have better responses
e.	No T cells within in tumor microenvironment pts don?t seem to respond as well and this is an area ?we as researchers need to improve T cell recruitment with novel combinations of injectables/vaccines (referenced TVEC)

?	Speaker said from podium that because Nivo showed OS, and afatinib didn't, he would use Nivo over afatinib.
?	He doesn't think P16 status at this time (HPV) should determine a treatment decision. 
?	He says in a patient that becomes unresectable during chemo radiation treatment, he would next go to Nivo. 
?	Audience member asked speaker would Nivo treatment be confusing in neo-adjuvant setting due to the tumor flare syndrome that?s sometimes seen before a response? He said there?s no data in Head and Neck, but he referenced there is data in lung that shows some patients who were treated beyond progression had a response and the initial flare is part of what occurs, while pd1 agent is starting to work.","Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests."

As part of our discussion with the society staff and physician leadership, the following insights were obtained:

1. Significant dissatisfaction with BMS over the use of television marketing.  Two physicians present both indicated they felt that the use of commercials for Nivolumab was unethical.  One physician stated he felt it was ""morally irreprehensible"" and expressed extreme frustration at having to take time with patients to explain why they aren't candidates for Nivolumab that he would have been using to discuss the treatment he was going to be prescribing for them.  The Society administrators commented that this is a common theme that has been previously verbalized by multiple physician groups that are part of the state society.

2.  Physicians identified the need for more IO education for their staff members - particularly the mid--level providers.  This was an outstanding opportunity to provide information on the IOCL efforts and the various educational resources the BMS provides (wallet cards, patient checklist, IMAR guides).  The physicians were both very impressed with the information provided and indicated that they would be in contact with me to come speak to their staffs

3.  The need for talks that could have CE associated with them at their annual meeting.  They were provided information on our unbranded materials and also the Unbranded IO talk.

4.  Physicians and society staff verbalized concerns related to cost and this provided an opportunity for a discussion on this by the matrix members including data on BMS' premier access program.  The attendees expressed interest in knowing more about these programs.

5.  One physician did comment on treating a 90+ y/o patient with nivolumab with metastatic melanoma who decided to stop treatment after two doses.  The patient went on palliative care following that, but the physician is getting texts every 3 weeks from the patient's son indicating that the large lesion on his father's back continues to regress and the patient is doing very well.

6.  One physician downloaded our Opdivo APP while we were meeting with the group!","RTL at academic practice stated that he is, ""very impressed"" with the response rates of OPDIVO in cHL patients.  He stated he his getting ready to initiate therapy for a cHL patient.  Had no concerns with Allo data when the cHL deck was presented.  Did ask for me to come back to present and educate his nurses on Opdivo, he said you forget BMT units have no Opdivo experience and are way behind in Opdivo education since they have no experience with solid tumors.  He did really appreciate the Opdivo app information for the iphone"
essentially,auto_found,Month,-1.453663532696338,-0.07403956341218146,['essentially'],13,"RTL shared that essentially all of his NSCLC nivo  responders are progressing after about 6 months.  His only longer-term responders had an early toxicity requiring discontinuation, so he believe toxicity does have a positive correlation. TL does not think that PD1 monotherapy will provide LT durable survival and that emergence of other checkpoints may be contributing to 'resistance'.  While understands that they are the obvious starting spots for trials, does not believe that either ipi or chemo combo will be more effective. Is excited to see partners such as as CD138, KIR, OX40","1.	Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",Community TL shared that he participated in a SCCHN trial with pembro in combination with another I-O agent which enrolled EXTREMELY quickly and went on to elaborate that these patients have essentially no options that offer significant benefit therefore any chance to get them on I-O therapy is ideal

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval

He is completely perplexed by the CM026 >50% negative data.  Thinks that this is likely ?a fluke?, but given the magnitude of benefit in 024 doesn?t think that small difference in patient populations could make data from ?super positive? to ?solidly negative? between trials so ?could be a real difference?. 

Note that prior to ESMO data, TL had low expectations overall for KN024 data, thinking magnitude would likely be reasonably small and that he would not likely make a huge push to PDL1 test everyone at 1L, so this is a marked shift in his attitude after seeing data.

+++CM-026 ? frequently made comments+++
?	Seemed to be already aware that CM-026 had not met any of its endpoints.
?	Attributed negative results to weak study design and risky research hypotheses.  
?	At this stage, would not change anything to CM-227.
?	Is comfortable with recommendations for nivo and pembro in latest NSCLC NCCN guidelines.","During a meeting to proactively discuss the results of CM-026, a NAI, chair of a pathway committee for lung cancer shared the following insight:
?	When asked about what he learned at ESMO that was important, his response was: ?Opdivo has had a nice ride, but based on ESMO data Keytruda has now won in the 1L setting and Tecentriq in the 2L setting?. 
?	For 1L, further explained that Keytruda will become SOC for patients with tumor PDL1 expression ?50% (PL-based CT still best option for patients with PDL1 expression <50%).
?	For 2L, and when asked ?why Tecentriq??, explained that nivo, pembro, and atezo are all equivalent. Rationale for giving preference to Tecentriq: 1) more experience with the agent (his institution has contributed to multiple atezo trials); 2) convenience of q3w for the patients (unnecessary to see patients more frequently than q3w to ensure optimal safety; insensitive to the argument that median number of doses is similar with q2w and q3w for a majority of patients given median duration of treatment of ~3mo). ?I also love nivo, but I have no reason to use it?. ?In 2L pembro is at the bottom of the list? (personal unhappiness with Merck in recent times ? bad customer experience).","Local lung TL commented that when it comes to Q3W dosing convenience, you truly get two completely different preferences based on who you talk to. In her opinion, having experience treating pts at a city-based, academic cancer center as well as a more rural satellite clinic, those pts that are being seen in the smaller satellites are usually in favor of coming to the office more often due to the social aspects of it (often older population without day jobs), whereas those that are being seen at academic centers want to come in less frequently due to other responsibilities or the hassle of parking, travel, etc."

a). The study did not include a treatment group with Nivolumab at 3 mg/kg. 
 b). We should compare Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W vs Nivolumab 3mg/kg Q3W in randomized fashion.
 c). Our competitor has done a phase-3 study comparing pembrolizumab Q2W vs Q3W, while we have not.","RTL commented that, while it may not be popular opinion among some physicians in a time when requirements for FDA approvals are changing, he feels the more traditional way that BMS has approached studies using randomized studies and waiting for appropriate endpoints has made their overall breadth of data with nivo much stronger and more reputable than other competitors that have garnered approvals on single arm, very small studies."

This will initially only include select VA location, but could eventually be expanded to all VA oncology centers ahead of an actual indication.","I met with NCCN panelist for SCLC (though sees mostly NSCLC) at an NCCN center in  midwest.  She offered these insights:

She stated in her patient population she is seeing patients come in with info, asking for pembro as it did not ""fail"" trial like nivo.  Patients on nivo not asking to switch

On NCCN panel and SCLC she stated that Nivo and Nivo/Ipi given 2B rather quickly and without much discussion.  Stated this was bar was so low in second line SC.  She stated this ""sort of thing"" is considered by panel.  Stated bar would be somewhat higher in first line SCLC  (Topo/etc. has good RR but poor DOR, both important)

She, like others, felt pembro would likely get NCCN listing at 50% when data published.  She felt for nivo in first line the bar for listing would be quite high.  i.e. as pembro failed primary endpoint, if there was positive data (say at ESMO) for a cut-off above 5%, that data would have to be very good to get a listing.  This contrasts to most other panelists opinions I have heard.

On the design of 026 she felt that BMS probably had good advice given to us at ad boards when designing trial but we did not listen (she did not expand on this)

She stated that her institution just started testing for PDL-1 in house.  Prior it took 2-3 weeks for results.  Now takes 2 days"

He stated at his institution they almost exclusively use Opdivo in the lung setting.  He stated this was due to a strong rHe elationship with BMS, stressed his institutions clinical trial experience.  Stated they are using pembro in first line but there have not been many off study appropriate patients thus far.  He did not feel Nivo use has declined after ESMO or after Atezo approval.  Offered that they still do not have pembro on order sets.

He stated he has used single agent Nivo in SCLC but has yet to see a response.  He has recently switched to combo (he thought Nivo q2 and ipi 1 q 6 but was unsure)  Too early too judge.

On above he stated he has had no payer issues in SCLC using nivo or ipi/nivo

Thought that PDL-1 status was important in NSquamous, not in squamous

Stated he actually liked q2 over q3.  He stated most patients are local and it gives them a chance to monitor patients better.  He stated they are now dosing q2 for first 4 doses at institution.  After this patients go to central institution q 4 and go to a satellite institution with mostly NP for alternative dosing","Academic TL with regards to 227: in light of outcome of 026, thinks BMS is making a big mistake by keeping the single agent nivo arm active."
