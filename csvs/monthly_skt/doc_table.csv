?Imagine 20-25 AEs/TLs in a room having to make a dozen of decisions in half a day and put them in writing?. Easy decisions are made first ? those following a new approval by the FDA. Then come decisions about unapproved therapies for which new data have been published. The question becomes: ?what would a reasonable person do?? If results are exciting and the therapies are used off-label at several key academic sites, they are likely to make their way in the guidelines? Then, there is very little time left to discuss anything else. With regards to biomarkers, what many panelists like, and are used to, is what we see with TKIs ? a well-understood MOA, well-identified molecular targets, and a yes/no answer to a biomarker test. In a sense there is a waiting game: many panelists don?t like PD-L1 testing or feel unsure about the language to be used to include PD-L1 testing in the guidelines. The debate is about the risk of collateral damage (e.g., payer refusing to pay for patients with tumor PD-L1 expression below the cutting value; risks associated with not treating false negatives, i.e., low expressors who would respond to therapy). Ultimately, the decision becomes the default decision to wait until a better biomarker becomes available.

o	Checkpoint inhibition is relevant biologically
o	Sophisticated pre-clinical testing in animal models demonstrated biologic relevance
o	PDL1+ expressers demonstrate higher response in many different cancers
?	057 KM curves by PDL1 show higher response for higher expressers
?	017 not same, but different beast
?	012 shows higher response in higher expressors
o	the problem is not PDL1 (a good test), it?s Pharma that has confused with different cuts of data, etc.
o	PDL1 (life cycle of PDL1 as biomarker), PDL1 testing validated in 1st and 2L NSCLC
o	PD1 oversold as good for everybody, but actually only good for smaller percentages
o	Checkpoint IO only cost effective when they are employed for pts most likely to benefit (defined as predictive biomarker)
?	Testing will save 3.4 billion in US (jokingly)
o	PDL1 measurement by alt. methods (CfRNA) will help measure response.
o	PDL1 testing will become SOC for 1L in advanced NSCLC

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

TLs have also referenced the findings of Spranger et al. (Nature reference below) who investigated the gene-expression profiles of 266 cutaneous melanomas and divided them into inflamed and non-inflamed cohorts. They found that ?-catenin signaling was active in the non-inflamed cohort and an increased CTNNB1 (?-catenin) score was predictive for a lack of T-cell infiltration.  Reconstitution with Flt3 ligand dendritic cells reversed resistance to immunotherapy (anti-CTLA + anti-PD1). The WNT/?-catenin pathway may contribute to immune evasion in other tumor entities beyond melanoma and may represent one mechanism of primary resistance to immunotherapy.  This was investigated in ASCO 2016 abstract 8565 SCLC and similar trend was observed of increased ?-catenin signaling in non-inflamed phenotype and lack of t cell infiltration.  Two additional presentations mentioned were biomarkers in immunotherapy and inflammation as next checkpoint.

?	This algorithm would take into account patient specific factors, such as patient?s performance status, and also baseline labs.  
?	It would define an algorithm in terms of class of agents, such as PD1 inhibitors, instead of be product specific.
?	AI currently does not test for PDL1 status prior to treatment initiation.
?	AI mentioned that he still considers individual patient specific characteristics in deciding whether to start on Nivo monotherapy versus regimen, such as performance status.
?	AI defines current practice in terms of nivolumab as 60% of patients getting monotherapy and 40% getting regimen.
?	He describes some anecdotal experience of seeing patients respond to regimen after not seeing a response on initial Pembro treatment.  He quantified that 1 out of 5 patients, he might see this type of occurrence.
?	When issue of cost arose, was able to reinforce with AI that the cost of regimen is only incrementally more expensive, around 6%, higher than the cost of sequential ipi followed by nivo.  
?	Reinforced with AI that the true cost of regimen treatment needs to take into account that 57% of patients in 069 received median number of doses (the full combo portion of treatment) and that only around 14% of patients were treated for 1 year.  
?	Broadened AI?s consideration of true cost parameters, as evidenced by his agreement that this needs to be considered in terms of true cost of regimen.  
?	In response to his question about sequential therapy, shared that nivo followed by ipi, as well as the reverse sequential regimens, did not show as good efficacy or more favorable AE profile compared to regimen.  
?	AI referenced his institution?s goal of conducting outcomes studies, in melanoma and beyond.  Offered connecting AI with BMS HEOR colleague to explore potential collaboration.

Factors that increase the risk of ocular AEs are currently unknown.  

Less serious AEs are managed with topical corticosteroids, while serious AEs warrant withholding IO therapy and treating with IV corticosteroids, particularly when the optic nerve is involved.  Cyclosporine and artificial tears are used to manage dry eyes associated with IO agents.  As the AEs can worsen very quickly, both ophthalmologists and medical oncologists should identify and treat them without delay, as well as educate patients proactively on the symptoms.

He shared the following insights:

On PDL-1 expression, when discussing the indications and trial designs of the current 2 agents, he proactively stated that felt rather strongly that the way the trials were designed should guide how the agents are used.  In discussing potential first line use, he stated that as pembrolizumab is being studied in this setting in the greater than 50% staining population, then pembro really should be limited in it?s use in that population.  He stated that if Nivo is studied in greater than 5% (or 1%), then Nivo should be used in that population.  He did not feel one agent should be used in a manner that was supported by another agents data

On the converse, he stated that even if Merck is trying to ?market? pembro as the drug of choice in the ?positive? or ?high staining? patient that this was not accurate.  He stated the data in this select population is just as good with Nivolumab and that doctors should feel as comfortable with both agents in the high staining population.

He added at his site they mostly use Nivo (pembro limited mostly to trials) as the data reflects results irrespective of PDL-1 status

Andy discussed various trial information.  We also discussed NSCLC screening, which he felt his hospital was not doing enough of.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).

uuid-f826cf96c99841c48409490b66d4e25a,"Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)",0, 7,-0.0130443,0,0,0,0,0,0.792325012842,0

NSCLC:
?	Believes that Nivo3+Ipi1q6w will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status
o	Since chemo still yields better ORR, thinks it can still be primary option in 1L
?	Doesn?t believe that concurrent I-O and chemo will have better efficacy than when sequenced and will produce worse AEs
o	Doesn?t see I-O monotherapy as a realistic future treatment option, unless patient is very frail, (made analogy to current use of chemo monotherapy versus doublets or triplets)
?	Checkmate-012:
o	ORR: expects the number in PD-L1 non-expressers to be higher in future studies than that seen in the -012 study
?	Rationale: if Nivo monotherapy yields 14% and Durva+Treme can approach 30%, there?s no reason to think that Nivo+Ipi won?t reach ORR comparable to Durva+Treme
?	Attributed to small sample size
o	Understands that safety/ toxicity will be a concern for some oncologists, but thinks that most will become comfortable monitoring for and managing the AEs associated with regimen  
?	Reiterated that % of patient that discontinued because of AEs was comparable to Nivo monotherapy and that there were 0 treatment-related deaths
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Considers the impactful enough to allow payers to justify coverage/ reimbursement
SCLC:
?	Checkmate -032:
o	Says that Nivo1+Ipi3 will eventually become standard of care (SoC) for all patients with SCLC, regardless of PD-L1 status, (particularly since <25% of patients are PD-L1 expressers)
?	Particularly encouraged by response in platinum-resistant where there are no good treatment options and great unmet need
o	Finds ORR to be very encouraging and a good surrogate for OS in this patient population
o	Believes that data is strong and robust enough to allow community oncologists to use in practice
?	Believes educating community practices about monitoring and IMARs is crucial considering the 3 deaths in the two regimen arms

?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.

?	BMS predominant way of presenting biomarker ? outcome relationships in overlapping biomarker categories is flawed and potentially misleading.

Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo.

Subsequent Therapy:  He found the fact that ~60% of Nivo patients didn?t get 2L therapy intriguing as these pts still did very well.  He further questioned what happed to the 40% who received subsequent therapy (from a subgroup analysis perspective). He wondered if the mOS improved substantially in this group and that drove the mOS for the Nivo arm.  This lead to a discussion of pts who received 2nd/3rd line Nivo and go on to receive subsequent therapy with a standard chemo agent (Gem, Doc) and have dramatic unexpected responses.  His team is actually analyzing internal data to address this question Nivo ? Chemo.  They?re evaluating ~50-60 patients who received a PD1 inhibitor followed by chemo.  Scans are being reviewed by a blinded radiologist to see if there is a signal that these patients do better with this sequencing. He hypothesizes this sequence will improve mOS and stated they have seen an early positive trend in RR and OS in this subgroup.  From a hypothesis perspective, the exposure to Nivo may ?reprogram? the tumor microenvironment in such a way that allows the tumor become more accessible and vulnerable to subsequent therapies.

NTL2:  There is a potential that pts with Lynch syndrome do worse but we need a better sample size to really judge.  It seems that these patients can have very late responses.
NTL2:  BMS may have more data in BRAF mutated pts in MSI CRC study but all of the pts that I have treated have responded
NTL3:   pseudoprogression real?
NTL2:  I think that there were a couple but they are not common.  Most responses are quite early.
NTL3:  I think it?s more of a myth.  Are you trying to lie to yourself and say it?s pseudoprogression to keep treating.
NTL3:  Do you think that there is potential for treating in the adjuvant setting rather than in tumor reductive setting?  
NTL2:  Melanoma data shows that there is great potential for immunotherapy in adjuvant.
NTL3:  When I see high responses across tumor types, I am now seeing that MSI testing is the most important thing.  Should we be testing for MSI in all patients?

He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system",0, 2,0.0341395,0,0,0.615477663275,0,0,0,0

He uses a lot of PD-1 agents and he mostly uses Pembro (though has used nivo appox 5 times with at least 2 responses).  The reasons were multi-factorial.

His reasons were:  1)  Felt pembro offered better SE profile (personal experience)    2) Pembro cheaper  3)  Better for patients being q3

We discussed all this in detail but briefly:

We discussed BMS cost data.  He felt the wastage issue does not help much.  For example he would use 200 pembro if the patients would ?require? say 220.  He said ?Think about it:  If there is an AE you do not dose reduce.  The reason is that going down the dose curve does not really change anything once a critical dose is there.?   He felt the same with efficacy, as long as it was ?close? the patient would get the benefit.   Did not worry about small mg differences and thus felt pembro cheaper.

We also discussed Keynote 10 data.  He did not feel Merck?s different dosages were an issue (again mentioned Roy Herbst)?He actually said BMS did studies poorly by taking all comers.

He felt patients with 1-2 years of life do not want to live in doctor office (q2 vs q3)

uuid-73859302c2454734ac461f582df73d68,"Met with a nationally recognized TL/AI NCCN lung panelist who shared the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI had a question about clarifying the cost of Opdivo, given that it?s Q2w dosing, and in comparison to Keytruda, given that it?s Q3w dosing. 
?	He stated that his understanding is that Opdivo is more expensive than Keytruda, given that Opdivo is dosed more frequently at Q2w dosing compared to Keytruda which is dosed Q3w dosing.  He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost.",0, 3,0.0154914,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0456923958918

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance",0, 4,0.0267622,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
