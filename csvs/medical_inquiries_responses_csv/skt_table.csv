Offered to send documents. Caller accepted and provided email address. CS 02Nov2016","Informed caller of the particular indications that the flat dosing is approved for. Informed caller that the study was model-based and used the data from the clinical trials to create the flat dose. Informed caller that the dosing change was initiated in order to save on waste and shorten preparation time, overall make processes easier for healthcare providers as well as patients. Caller stated that this flat-dosing would end up costing the patient more money. Caller inquired as to whether there would be a vial that would contain the entire dose. Informed caller that we didn't have any information regarding the creation of a single dose vial containing the 240mg.

A nonconventional or unconventional response (immune-related response) has been defined as a complete response, partial response, or stable disease following an initial increase in tumor burden.1 An exploratory analysis of responses was performed in patients treated beyond investigator-assessed progression from one phase 2 study (CA209-205) and one phase 1 study (CA209-039).2,3,4 Nivolumab treatment beyond progression resulted in non-conventional benefit in 8 out of 11 patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.2 Further details are provided in the Detailed Information.
