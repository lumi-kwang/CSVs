"[SCCHN, TL told, GU]"," 08-14-2016

A Lung SCCHN TL told me that he has already been visited by Merck and that since they don't have a need for PD-L1 testing and the ORR between Nivo and Pembro look similar, he will likely use Pembro for most patients even after Nivo gains approval in SCCHN.  He likes that we have a RCT and OS survival but at this time not enough to just use Nivo"

At an international GI conference, a NTL said, about advances in immunotherapy in CRC:

We continue to pursue immunotherapy because although conventional therapies push survival curves to the right, IO pushes it up

ORR about 16% with nivolumab. Interestingly, the responses were across the board and were durable.

In GI cancers, there are nice and deep responses with MMR deficiency.  Responses are durable and pt are ready for treatment holiday after 2 years of therapy with maintained response."
"[tissue, mutational load, status]"," 03-25-2016

The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?"
"[requests, perform, lab]"," 12-12-2016

A Lung NTL told me that he has heard the Foundation is using the Ventana SP142 antibody to fulfill requests for some of its PD-1 testing results.  The TL is aware of the Project Blueprint data and does not believe this test should be used.  The TL noted that this might hurt Merck since the SP142 test seems to read consistently lower than the Dako tests and could turn >50% staining to less than and thus out of label for Pembro.  TL went on to say this might effect BMS also since some physicians have been reserving Opdivo for patients with PD-L1 negative tests and Atezolizumab with its q3w dosing might be desirable."
"[reduce, wastage, cost]"," 12-01-2016

Met with the drug information department of a key national/regional institution AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI reactively shared that her institution conducted some internal analysis comparing the cost of Nivo and Pembro.  
?	We reviewed the HEOR data comparing Nivo and Pembro showing the trend of less wastage with Nivo compared to Pembro and potential savings across a range of patient weights due to the vial disposition.  
?	She shared that due to the reduced wastage with Nivo use, with the availability of 40mg and 100mg vials, and the fact that Pembro only comes in 100mg vials, Nivo came out as more cost effective due to the reduced wastage in their analysis."
"[label, insurance, compassionate use]"," 12-05-2016

RTL shared that thus far when using pembro in the 1L NSCLC setting for patients < 50% PDL1 expression they have met no resistance in having it covered by insurance; TL feels that the insurance company only really looking for 1L data in general and the specifics to PDL1 status aren't necessary (so far) in reimbursement"
"[patient population, difference, CM 026]"," 11-18-2016

Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.
?	His institution is wanting to narrow available PD1 agents in their pathways and will be sitting down to evaluate the 2L lung space as well."
"[mentioned, poster, SCLC]"," 08-24-2016

Met with a regional drug use management and pathway implementation AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights.

?	He says they are still in contracting for past year with VIA, which has not been finalized.  
?	At this point in time, VIA pathway not yet implemented for his organization, but he has access to the VIA ?sandbox? so he is able to access the system and has knowledge of pathways for tumor types.
?	In regards to SCLC, he reactively disclosed that the pathway has been updated recently after the update of the NCCN guidelines (inclusion of regimen as option in 2L).
?	AI said that Nivo is on pathway for NSCLC.  If a patient does not have a PDL1 test, it?s unknown, or the test shows a low or non-expressor, then Nivo is the choice.  
?	The pathway asks if a NSCLC patient has a positive PDL1 test, without referring to specific PDL1 thresholds.  If it?s positive, then Keytruda is offered.  If it?s negative, Opdivo is offered.  
?	He mentioned that VIA pathway adherence goal is 80% for his organization (didn?t specific whether this is target across tumors or is goal for each tumor type).
?	He says VIA pathway is provider centric, which is useful in community practices, and less useful in a academic setting where providers are more familiar with SOC and understand the data. 
?	AI said that the VIA pathway adherence also has a patient choice component, such as a preference for orals over infusible medicines.  He said this is not fully incorporated into the system yet."
"[prefer, 2nd line, agents]"," 12-07-2016

A regional TL stated that while he thinks most of the PD-1/PD-L1 agents are going to be equivalent in terms of efficacy across the different tumor types, he would prefer to use Opdivo for everything. He has the most experience with Opdivo and thinks that consistency with dosing and safety management would help reduce errors in their practice."
"[chemo, chemotherapy, Ipi+Nivo]"," 11-10-2016

Local community TL in commenting on CM-026 results of PD1 monotherapy not being enough in 1L broad NSCLC patient population, he does feel IO-IO combo is the answer as he truly feels there needs to be something priming the immune system in addition to PD1 therapy, however he does feel ipi is far too toxic and other combos of nivo should be focused on more; TL stated that NSCLC patients are often more beaten down than melanoma patients so while he does feel there can perhaps remain a role for ipi+nivo in melanoma, another IO+nivo option will be better for NSCLC patients"
"[ie, space, histology]"," 03-01-2016

Nurses at a large gathering for ONS dinner in Oregon, interested in comments regarding chemo precautions for infusion nurses and pharmacy staff in relation to historic uses of chemotherapy drugs and precautions. Article in ONS magazine regarding importance of implementing safety in administration of cancer agents triggered discussion. Nurse liaison retorted with the importance of safety precautions with mixing or administering Opdivo and Yervoy products and discussed potential for long term effects for patients (ie pregnancy precautions). Nurses volunteered they are reforming their current SOP's and practices in efforts to protect nurses, and provide specific guidance for pregnant nurses administering cancer agents."
"[Nivo monotherapy, ipi/nivo combo, expectations]"," 06-12-2016

Onc shared full understanding of 1st line implication and is impressed with data released at ASCO with ipi/nivo combo. Doc quoted the exact dosing for ipi/nivo including q6 or q12w dosing of ipi.  Doc mentioned best case 1st line patients get 10-12 months control with chemo, this will ""double that expectation"". Doc ""cant wait to see OS"""
"[treat patients, clinically, SD]"," 04-03-2016

A lung RTL from NY City volunteered that he suspects that AztraZeneca's MYSTIC trial in 1st line NSCLC may be under powered to show a significant difference in PFS versus chemotherapy.  He highlighted his own experience in 209-227 in which he has observed good objective responses in patients on either the Opdivo+Yervoy and chemotherapy arms.  The TL beleives the true benefit will show up in the durability of the clinical responses for the I-O treated patients."
"[mutations, BRAF, EGFR]"," 05-27-2016

A community oncologist shared that at his practice PD-L1 testing has been recently included together with testing for EGFR activating mutations and ALK translocation to the initial molecular evaluation of patients with NSQ-NSCLC."

"[tumor, mets, reduction]"," 04-15-2016

A former lung NCCN panelist who recently gave position to junior faculty member/ Thoracic Oncology chair at an NCI-designated cancer center volunteered these insights regarding the evolving NSCLC space and how it will most likely be managed once the market has 3-4 PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors:
  ?	Believes the only legitimate advantage that Pembro has over Nivo monotherapy in NSCLC is q3w versus q2w dosing
    ?	Believes that PK shows that Nivo (and possibly Pembro) are administered too frequently
  ?	Has moved patients on Nivo maintenance (after initial response) to q3w and q4w without sacrificing efficacy
   o	PD-L1 testing: ALWAYS tests in 1L and NEVER tests in 2L and beyond
   o	Hasn?t seen sufficient evidence to change mindset that PD1s all have comparable efficacy, and any differences will be negligible to most oncologists 
   o	Found review of Keynote 010 versus Checkmate 057 data interesting and compelling, but likely of little value to the NCCN panel
    ?	Believes that showcasing PD-L1 positive 057 (>1%) data only serves to try to show superiority over Pembro
  ?	Doesn?t think the NCCN committee will feel comfortable acknowledging a significant difference between the 2 therapies because there are too many variables (NonSq+Sq in 010 versus NonSq only in 057, different tests to assess PD-L1, etc.) between the 2 data sets to allow for meaningful comparisons
  ?	Regardless, thinks it would be a short-lived victory because the real winners and losers will be decided over the next 18 months with launches of Atezo and Durva.  
  ?	Future of NSCLC NCCN Guidelines:
   o	Understands that NCCN guidelines will need to evolve as multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved in order to avoid developing guidelines that resemble Multiple Myeloma?s NCCN Guidelines, which is just a list of approved therapies rather than any attempt to guide
   o	Envisions that future NCCN guidelines may look something like this in 1L:
?	For bulky tumors that need drastic reduction: Chemo +/- immunotherapy
?	PD-L1-positive tumor: PD1 montherapy (Nivo or Pembro)
  ?	PD-L1 inhibitors (Atezo) will show lower efficacy than PD-1 inhibitors with better tox profile, so will likely be used for more fragile patients or those experiencing severe toxicity from PD1s
    ?	PD-L1-negative tumor: regimen therapy (Ipi+Nivo or Durva+Treme)
  ?	Although Durva+Treme may not have the efficacy of Ipi+Nivo, believes that being first to market to will allow D+T to play meaningful role
  ?	Hadn?t heard of NSCLC Evidence Blocks, but after explanation didn?t see their value
   o	Finds assessment process to be arbitrary and results meaningless
   o	When told that Pembro and Nivo were given identical scores, exclaimed that example serves as proof of tool?s irrelevance"

He said that this was simple math, with more frequent Q2w dosing being more frequent and thus more expensive than Q3w dosing.  He stated that he thinks Opdivo is 20-30% more expensive than Keytruda.
o	Reactively shared HEOR reactive deck with him. 
o	Walked him through the HEOR Opdivo reactive approved cost slides.  Started with slide 2 (shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg; shows example for cost of infusion for 80kg patient). 
o	AI stated he was not aware that Opdivo is available in both 100mg and 40mg vials and thus was unaware of flexibility and less wastage with both available vials.
o	He stated he was not aware that Keytruda is only available in 100mg vials.  He thought that it was still available as 50mg vial.  
?	Reactively shared slide which shows Opdivo available as both 40mg and 100mg vials, effectively communicating to him that Opdivo cost per mg is same with either vial size, and that this allows for less wastage in acquiring product, which allows for stepwise increase in price per infusion/month as weight increases.  This leads to Opdivo, for example, being less expensive than Keytruda at patient weights such as 70kg, and roughly equivalent monthly pricing at 80kg. 
?	Reactively shared with him that Keytruda is no longer available in the 50mg vial, although it is still listed in the PI which adds to confusion, and that it is only now available in 100mg vial.
?	AI seemed receptive, stating that he was previously unaware of this information and it was something new to him.  
o	Then proceeded to review with him a table comparing costs associated with Keytruda compared with Opdivo, providing ranges of costs associated per dose and month with increasing patient weights.  Communicated to him that the price per infusion between Keytruda and Opdivo is not the same.  Between 55-100kg, Keytruda per dose is $8632 (Keytruda only available 100mg, not 50mg anymore).  For Opdivo, it ranges from $4381 to $7302 due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg vials.  I linked cost per infusion to monthly price that is calculated by annualizing the cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost, which takes into account different Q2 v. Q3w dosing frequencies.  
?	AI indicated that with this explanation, he now follows logic of annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He acknowledged this way of annualizing the cost ?because in some months, patients will receive more than 1 dose of Keytruda?.  
?	The above realization seems to have addressed his misperception that due to simple math, Opdivo Q2w dosing is always more expensive than Keytruda Q3w dosing, because he acknowledged understanding of logic behind annualizing cost and then extrapolating back to monthly cost.   
?	He asked a colleague (value person in dept.) to come into the meeting and proceeded to demonstrate his understanding of the above logic, by walking his colleague through an example for a 70kg patient, which resulted in Opdivo actually being cheaper than Keytruda. 
o	Reviewed table with him for costs associated with 70 through 90kg patients, noting that Opdivo is cheaper per month for some, about same, and more expensive for some higher weight patients.
o	Slide 7 showed him comparison of Opdivo v. Keytruda in terms of cost per month curves.  Keytruda is same cost per month from 50-100kg pts, while Opdivo is more stepwise increase in cost per month as increase weights due to availability of both 40mg and 100mg (equivalent cost per mg basis), which allows for less wastage in terms of ordering vials to meet a pts dose requirement.
?	AI seemed receptive to this graph as something new to him, and he also asked another colleague to take a look at this graph.  
o	Covered Slide 10, 11, 12 run through calculation process for range of patient weights, at 70, 80, and 90kg.  Noted how cost per month is calculated, by annualizing cost first and then extrapolating back to monthly cost to account for differences in Q2 and Q3w dosing.  
o	Slide 13 walked AI through an example of an inaccurate monthly cost calculation, due to ordering wrong vial size of Opdivo and not accounting for the fact that Keytruda is only available as 100mg vial (no longer available as 50mg vial).  
?	AI was intrigued by this slide and asked colleague to join the meeting to examine slide.   
?	Reiterated that due to Keytruda only being available in 100mg vial, and not 50mg vials, this leads to common under-pricing cost calculations per month.  
?	Reiterated that Opdivo monthly cost may commonly be inaccurately calculated with a higher price due to more wastage using a sub-optimal combination of vial sizes.  This occurs when the optimal combination of vial sizes combos are not ordered to minimize monthly/infusion cost."
"[clinical trials, management, based]"," 11-10-2016

While FL Blue considers clinical trial data (and trial inclusion / exclusion criteria), FDA labeling and NCCN guidelines in the development of their medical policy, NCCN guidelines are generally prioritized. 
- They take a product by product approach vs looking at specific disease states.
- Particularly within I/O?.they tend to be lenient in approving requests for use of therapies that may fall outside of their established Medical Policy.  E.g. with Opdivo RCC 
- They have a number of value based arrangements with providers with a focus on quality (OS / Patient satisfaction) as well as cost."
"[ipi/nivo, tox, observed]"," 04-13-2016

I met recently with an RTL and Opdivo Melanoma/NSCLC speaker, who is aware of CA209-384 (although is not participating in that study) and asked if we have addressed the same question in melanoma patients. 
TL stated he would consider stopping treatment for patients who show a CR or near-CR. 
In his opinion, the question 'when can we stop treatment with I/O agents' is interesting in lung but sadly not relevant for most patients due to the low CR rate.  
However, TL said that it's a very relevant question in melanoma, where the Ipi/Nivo combo is producing a higher frequency of CRs."
"[treatment, Expert, different]"," 03-25-2016

The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval 
?	TL panel member mentioned his experience has been that grade of immune-mediated AE likely correlated to depth of response
?	Consensus that the direction moving forward would be combination checkpoint inhibitor with targeted strategy.  Interesting how ?one major company going for targeted approach and another company doing immune checkpoint combination.?"
"[combination, atezolizumab, patient fails]"," 11-19-2016

NTL predicts that, even with durable responses seen with PD1 monotherapy, eventually almost all NSCLC patients will progress.  With basically all NSCLC patients receiving PD1 monotherapy at some point in their treatment plan, there will be a huge unmet need for effective treatments post-PD1.  This NTL, who is an investigator on several studies with IO+IO combinations, voiced opinion (based on her experience) that Ipi+Nivo seems to be the only IO+IO combo that can resurrect a response in patients who have failed PD1 monotherapy.  4-1BB, anti-KIR, OX40 etc do not seem to have this activity. TL said this speaks to the ability of Ipi to prime new T cells, rather than just relieving inhibition of existing lymphocyte populations."
"[IO therapy, low, obtained]"," 03-21-2016

A NCCN panelist for Multiple Myeloma stated that the PD1 data in multiple myeloma could be better but that he is every excited about the possibilities of combination IO therapies."
"[PDL-1, primary endpoint, difference]"," 12-05-2016

Had a recent meeting with Regional surrounding HN indication where physician was asked if our Phase 3 trial, with OS as a primary endpoint was meaningful to him, and he stated that he does not believe that the competitors Phase 2 trial (with ORR as enpoint) vs our Phase 3 trial makes a significant difference when selecting which therapy to use.  He believes that it will essentially boil down to cost."
"[ipi, 2nd line, sequencing]"," 06-12-2016

Oncologist reports after hearing data presented at asco regarding SCLC, that this is encouraging but that ""chemo can control disease quite well"". It will be hard to distinguish who will respond to IO vs chemo best. 

Oncologist also mentioned H&N data looking good but no distinction between nivo and pembro. The main advantage is that bms has ""ipi"" to add to opdivo and get the best efficacy. He believes that Opdivo is exclusively used in 2nd line lung due to no testing requirements. He believes pd status will be more readily available in 1st line lung and the testing will not pose any challenges for clinicians."
"[noted, Ventana, volunteered]"," 12-12-2016

A Lung NTL told me that he has heard the Foundation is using the Ventana SP142 antibody to fulfill requests for some of its PD-1 testing results.  The TL is aware of the Project Blueprint data and does not believe this test should be used.  The TL noted that this might hurt Merck since the SP142 test seems to read consistently lower than the Dako tests and could turn >50% staining to less than and thus out of label for Pembro.  TL went on to say this might effect BMS also since some physicians have been reserving Opdivo for patients with PD-L1 negative tests and Atezolizumab with its q3w dosing might be desirable."
"[PD-L1 testing, lab, requests]"," 04-03-2016

A Lung RTL from NY City mentioned that his site does not routinely test for PD-L1 in any line of therapy for NSCLC patients.  He noted that of >200 patients treated in 2015 with I-O agents, a PD-L1 test was obtained in less than 10.  Primary reason to test was patient's request.  The Dermatopathology lab has chosen to use their own system with an IHC antibody from Cell Signaling.  The TL added that since his site is so busy, they often need 3-4 days ahead of time to get an open slot in the Infusion Center.  Thus, the TL and his colleagues are very uninterested in adding any delay for a test they see no value in."
"[monotherapy, nivo and pembro, performance status]"," 04-18-2016

TL described a PDL1+ pancreatic cancer patient who had a very large primary lesion and metastases. He initially treated with Opdivo monotherapy, with no response. He subsequently treated with a combination of Opdivo, Avastin, and chemotherapy. He then observed a rapid response in all lesions, with the primary lesion decreasing by 90+%. Patient is currently stable."
"[TLs, favor, KN]"," 11-18-2016

Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.
?	His institution is wanting to narrow available PD1 agents in their pathways and will be sitting down to evaluate the 2L lung space as well."
"[vial, PET, roll]"," 09-15-2016

Community oncologist described a recent Opdivo patient of his that he described as having ""waxing and waning tumor response over the past year"". He said that PET results have shown tumor progression and the subsequent regression off and on throughout the past year. Patient has had stable disease for over a year now and he was very interested in discussing patterns of response with nivo."
"[PD-L1 expression, scoring, immune cells]"," 10-28-2016

During a meeting to proactively discuss the results of CM-026, a NAI, chair of a pathway committee for lung cancer shared the following insight:
?	When probed about PD-L1 testing in 1L, mentioned that Roche has the best test, because it assesses PD-L1 expression on both the tumor and the immune cells. During a brief discussion about concordance of PD-L1 expression levels across tests, initially stated that evidence thus far indicates that all tests are equivalent; then agreed that SP142 is fundamentally different from the other tests. Eventually mentioned that his main concern is with PDL1 testing in general clinical setting: hospitals proposing the test are generally equipped with only one platform; commercial test results reported as + or ? without further comment."
"[agents, guide, regards]"," 08-23-2016

a national/regional melanoma AI and NCCN melanoma Panelist provided the following insights from the podium at a Immuno-oncology CME event.

?	MOA of nivo/ipi are synergistic.
?	Showed case of pt responding to ipi with initial worsening on ipi, then complete remission later
o	Underscores the point that providers have to be patient in waiting for immunotherapy responses on treatment.
?	In regards to PDL1 expression,?
o	The picture is murky
o	Because we see responses in some PDL1 negative pts, expression is not ?go or no go? factor in treatment
?	He says hopefully in the future we will have an algorithm to guide who to treat with monotherapy versus combo.
?	He raised the question of what is the optimal sequence to treat patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor and PD1 inhibitors, since there are some current studies with patients going on PD1 inhibitor therapy after BRAF inhibitor who showed responses.  
o	Do we treat with BRAF/MEK inhibitors first and then PD1, or other way around?
?	He noted these are the unanswered questions currently?
o	Optimal duration of therapy
o	Biomarkers to predict response
o	Combo v. sequential"
"[IO, compared, chemotherapy]"," 11-23-2016

TL stated the greatest limitation for IO-IO in NSCLC is convincing HCPs to be comfortable with the AE profile since it is different and less predicative than what they are traditionally a construed to with IO monotherapy and chemotherapy."
"[recently, issues, adverse events]"," 12-04-2016

Eduard Goldenberg and I met with a NCCN SCCC panelist.  On general Opdivo in lung he offered these insights:

He stated at his institution they almost exclusively use Opdivo in the lung setting.  He stated this was due to a strong rHe elationship with BMS, stressed his institutions clinical trial experience.  Stated they are using pembro in first line but there have not been many off study appropriate patients thus far.  He did not feel Nivo use has declined after ESMO or after Atezo approval.  Offered that they still do not have pembro on order sets.

He stated he has used single agent Nivo in SCLC but has yet to see a response.  He has recently switched to combo (he thought Nivo q2 and ipi 1 q 6 but was unsure)  Too early too judge.

On above he stated he has had no payer issues in SCLC using nivo or ipi/nivo

Thought that PDL-1 status was important in NSquamous, not in squamous

Stated he actually liked q2 over q3.  He stated most patients are local and it gives them a chance to monitor patients better.  He stated they are now dosing q2 for first 4 doses at institution.  After this patients go to central institution q 4 and go to a satellite institution with mostly NP for alternative dosing"
"[therapy, option, RR]"," 04-06-2016

RTL at a large academic center is ?not sold on brentuximab maintenance therapy due to lack of OS data.?  He does not see it as an established standard of care but will talk to pts about option post transplant.  He doesn?t use brentuximab as consolidative agent at this time but use at relapse."
"[inhibitor, PD-1, RR]"," 10-12-2016

Pharmacist at large community practice voluntarily shared that in her research of whether to give the flu shot with I-O agents she follows some guidance she read on Medscape stating:  a quote/advice given by Dr. Hallmeyer (panelist at unspecified meeting) advising to the audience, that patients on nivo or pembro (a PD-1) inhibitor can receive flu shots but those patients on ipi (CTLA-4) inhibitor should wait 6 to 8 weeks after the last dose - sharing that she and her colleagues typically see more AEs with ipi than nivo so the staff likes to be on the safe side"
"[partial, detect, increasingly]"," 11-20-2016

Academic NTL views PD1 agents as equivalent, so expects majority of R/M SCCHN post-platinum patients to receive Pembro, rather than Nivo, due to Pembro's convenience of Q3W dosing. However, TL doesn't think this will be an immediate spike in Pembro use because there are already a number of existing patients receiving Nivo (compassionate use), who will continue onto commercial Nivo. But any new post-platinum patients would likely receive Pembro."

1.	Biomarker:  He?s not routinely testing for PDL-1 status. He?s making his treatment decisions purely on a clinical basis because he doesn?t have enough confidence in PDL1 as a biomarker.  He stated although the outcomes are better for PDL1 + pts, PDL1- can still respond durably so he does not want to deprive a pt of the opportunity for long term survival based on PDL1 status.  

2.	Treatment Landscape:  NTL?s approach to melanoma pts:  he will attempt to treat all pts with Regimen front-line bc it gives them the best chance for long term OS.  If a pt is elderly (>75y), has comorbidities, or has pre-existing autoimmune disorders that he feels could be exacerbated on Regimen, he?ll treat with single agent Nivolumab.  He said he treats most elderly pts with single agent Nivo. He was in agreement with the robust efficacy of regimen and potential benefit for long term OS versus single agent.   He said pts don?t want a median increase in survival of a few months.  He said pts want to be on the ?tail end of curve? and that?s what he discusses with pts and that?s what Regimen/IO can provide.  NTL was extremely positive on Regimen data and hopes it will have similar results in other tumor types

3.	R&D Research Opportunities:  NTL brought up a discussion regarding mutations and response to immunotherapy.  NTL mentioned pts with high mutational load and tumors associated with high mutational burden tend to have better responses to IO.  We discussed reasoning for this was bc mutations often result in abnormal proteins which are recognized by intracellular immunological machinery, chopped up into small peptides, and presented on the tumor cell surface for immune cells to recognize.  Pts with high mutation load may have more tumor antigens present on the cell surface making them more visible to the immune system. I asked him if it would be a worthwhile research approach to identify potential targets in the intracellular immunological machinery of tumors that could be targeted to enhance the processing of mutated proteins so that you essentially have more mutated proteins being recognized, chopped up, and presented on the cell surface making the tumor even more visible to the immune system.  TL had an ?aha moment? and was very interested in this idea.  He asked if he could take this idea to his scientists in the lab for further investigation. He felt if you could manipulate the intracellular immunological machinery in the tumor to enhance the processing of mutated proteins (which is inherent to tumors) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, it could potentially result in a more synergistic response - exposing the tumor to the immune system"
"[ipi/nivo, tox, opinion]"," 04-13-2016

I met recently with an RTL and Opdivo Melanoma/NSCLC speaker, who is aware of CA209-384 (although is not participating in that study) and asked if we have addressed the same question in melanoma patients. 
TL stated he would consider stopping treatment for patients who show a CR or near-CR. 
In his opinion, the question 'when can we stop treatment with I/O agents' is interesting in lung but sadly not relevant for most patients due to the low CR rate.  
However, TL said that it's a very relevant question in melanoma, where the Ipi/Nivo combo is producing a higher frequency of CRs."
"[combination, Ipi+Nivo, tumor]"," 03-25-2016

The following unsolicited insights were provided by speakers from the podium at a recent oncology conference attended by national AI?s/TL?s in various tumor types and hematological malignancies.  

Breast 
?	While there is limited data, panel believed for metastatic triple negative breast immunotherapy is a high viable option
?	Sited studies currently ongoing with Merck and Roche in the neoadjuvant setting using IO with taxane.

Developmental Therapeutics
?	One panelist made a comment to the audience about VALUE of care; the importance of consideration of value in oncology care.  
o	For example, the importance of consideration of the idea of limiting lines of therapy before patient goes to hospice.  Also, he mentioned some pathways are thinking of limiting to 2 lines before hospice.

Hematological malignancies Board
?	Panelist said RVD is strong 1st line therapy, based upon the SWOG trial presented at ASH 2015, because of OS with RVD.  He says he believes KRD may be treatment of future, even though KRD not indicated for 1L currently.
?	Panelist says there is trial of RD v. KRD which may show whether it is a good 1st line treatment.

Lung 
Testing
?	Consensus with the lung panel that ordering broad molecular testing should always be an option and should be standard of care however the known issue is limitation of tissue
?	Concerns around timing of results from NGS may delay treatment for patients, ~3 weeks is too long especially when 15% of these patients waiting never receive treatment
?	Consensus that liquid biopsy is an exploratory option now as concerns around false negative rates but should be explored in the setting of a clinical trial and in cases where tissue is not available
?	Huge focus on targeted therapy during the meeting given that the chair is a huge believer of testing in all lines.  
?	A case was presented focusing on the following scenario:  For second line treatment of a patient with NSCLC?squamous histology, Zubrod PS 1:
o	70% of the audience selected, Nivolumab without sending for PD?L1 testing.
o	10% of the audience selected, Nivolumab only if PD?L1 testing is positive (>1%)
o	18% of the audience selected, Pembrolizumab if PD?L1 positive (>1%)
?	TL chairing the meeting stated that PD1 data in a ?chaotic state?
?	Panel members expressed that PD-L1 may not be the best marker in dealing with tumor heterogeneity in lung
?	One panel member said If he happens to have PDL1 info already and if it?s positive and more than 1%, then he might use pembro, given more patient friendly Q3w schedule.  If PDL1 info is not available, then he goes straight to Nivo without PDL1 testing and would argue that Q2w dosing is not that bad.  
?	A few RTLs mentioned that in the setting of >1% PD-L1 expression they would give pembrolizumab for patients needing the Q3W dosing schedule and would do the same in adeno histology in the 2L setting.
?	Panel discussed managing immune-mediated AEs from PD1 agents are often responsive to immunosuppression.  
?	One panelist said data for SQ and NSQ very different.  The case being discussed was a SQ patient.  He mentioned that IASCLC is doing studies around PDL1 testing.  He says he would change treatment approach of going straight to nivo if this was a NSQ patient (didn?t elaborate more).
?	Lung panelist mentioned to the audience about the availability of the ASCO/MSKCC DrugAbacus tool (assesses the value of drugs compared to pricing given consideration of factors such as cost, toxicity, and efficacy). He mentioned the idea that If you can?t show that a drug is better, it supports considering restrictions.


Melanoma
Adjuvant
?	Panel presented a case where patient was given adjuvant ipilimumab as part of the EORTC trial and after 2 cycles of 10 mg/kg dose patient developed severe GI perforations.  Issues raised were 1) why the 10 mg/kg dose was even chosen 2) significant cost but was later amended to the dose being supported through BMS APP 3) significant toxicities leading to discontinuation
?	Panel discussed while the incidence low, case of myocarditis and it is a significant concern to monitor for 
?	One RTL said the toxicities of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg are quite sobering comparing it to IL2

Testing	
?	One RTL mentioned he is not testing outside of clinical trials, and is not done routinely as data is still revolving
?	Discussion on which types of patients would tolerate regimen best and consensus on those who are healthy and with good performance status
?	Some community oncologist are using PD-1 inhibitors off label for cutaneous SCC as they?ve seen positive responses to PD1-inhibitors and have not been turned down by insurance companies, often challenging for some patients to participate in a clinical trial program because of location
?	RTL mentioned that we are in a unique space where knowledge of drug is going to move faster than a FDA approval

"[ipi, subsequent, sequencing]"," 08-23-2016

a national/regional melanoma AI and NCCN melanoma Panelist provided the following insights from the podium at a Immuno-oncology CME event.

?	MOA of nivo/ipi are synergistic.
?	Showed case of pt responding to ipi with initial worsening on ipi, then complete remission later
o	Underscores the point that providers have to be patient in waiting for immunotherapy responses on treatment.
?	In regards to PDL1 expression,?
o	The picture is murky
o	Because we see responses in some PDL1 negative pts, expression is not ?go or no go? factor in treatment
?	He says hopefully in the future we will have an algorithm to guide who to treat with monotherapy versus combo.
?	He raised the question of what is the optimal sequence to treat patients with BRAF/MEK inhibitor and PD1 inhibitors, since there are some current studies with patients going on PD1 inhibitor therapy after BRAF inhibitor who showed responses.  
o	Do we treat with BRAF/MEK inhibitors first and then PD1, or other way around?
?	He noted these are the unanswered questions currently?
o	Optimal duration of therapy
o	Biomarkers to predict response
o	Combo v. sequential"

Large PBM quote:

The reason for Price Protection should be self-evident in the media ? price inflation of prescription drugs has been excessive and exposes our clients to unpredictable costs when setting budgets/premiums/etc.   

As a result, clients are demanding that we enter ?fixed cost? contracts where the pricing of a product is predetermined based on a set WAC during the course of an agreement, or else a Price Protection ceiling above which the net cost effect of a manufacturer?s pricing strategy will not affect the plan?s cost for the product. 

Additionally, when looking to prefer products, Price Protection is becoming an increasingly important feature of rebate contracts. For example, if I have price protection for Xarelto and Pradaxa, but not Eliquis, clients may be inclined to select your competitors because of the predictable nature of the spend.   A single price increase by BMS/Pfizer could wipe out much or all of the rebate value for a plan over the course of a contract If they select your  product, while they can be assured that the decision to prefer the other products would make sure a plan can?t go too far astray during the life of the contract for competitors offering PP."

Met with a NSCLC NCCN Panelist national AI and regional head and neck AI, who reactively provided the following insights:

?	He thinks that failure of CM 026 trial to achieve a difference in PFS was due to the trial design, with BMS reaching for a patient population PDL1 greater than or equal to 5% as too broad.
?	He said that perhaps Merck reached for a population that was too narrow, having conducted the study at so many locations just to achieve the appropriate numbers of patients in KN.
?	He found it odd that sex was not stratified for in CM 026, given that it's a well-known prognosticator of how well patients tend to do.  
?	AI thinks that despite the negative result in CM 026, he thinks that Nivo and Pembro are not that different.
?	He expressed that KN trials combining chemo with IO have inflated response rates due to the chemo component.
?	In reactive discussion of the FDA Blueprint analysis showing great discordance between the higher sensitivity staining Merck and BMS assays compared to the lesser sensitivity of Atezo?s SP142 assay, AI pushed back asking why would you test using SP142 anyway, since testing is not required with Atezo and nonexpressers still may respond. Proceeded to walk him through Biomarker reactive slides outlining how Atezo?s less sensitive assay in theory may lead to classifying some expressors as non-expressors, due to the decreased sensitivity and discordance with BMS/Merck assays.
?	He expressed that Atezo?s q3w dosing frequency will be a factor in his institution?s selection of a 2L treatment, especially due to their impacted availability of infusion chair time and spaces.
?	After we informed him that the SCCHN indication is weight based dosing, He said that his institution might just use flat dosing for SCCHN like in other indications to reduce confusion and inconsistency in the pharmacy preparation.
?	He was already aware of the newly approved 141 SCCHN indication.  After reviewing the CM 141 QOL results showing favorable maintenance of PRO?s when comparing the Nivo group?s maintenance of QOL compared to the sharp decreases seen in the chemo group, he acknowledged the results and stated that QOL results are essential to any such trials in the head and neck space.

TLs state the OAK data is intriguing in that the agent works in the all comer population, has apparent efficacy in the PDL1 non-expressing population, has q3w convenience, and a highly tolerable safety profile. When questioned about how to choose between agents in the 2L the TLs in general still feel that atezo is a ""me too"" drug and that nivo has such broad indications across tumor types with proven efficacy and support for many others that there is an established loyalty to nivo. Hence, the TLs predict varied physician preference (""choose one or the other and neither are wrong"") in the 2L."

Regional H/N TL commented that even with EXTREME being the SoC for 1L rec/met, she's surprised there isn't more of an option left to physicians for clinical trial settings where investigator's choice could be part of the protocol. She expressed that EXTREME is very rarely used as-is and is very challenging to sell a pt on when they know they may be randomized to this therapy. Most often 5-FU is swapped out for a taxane and occasionally cetuximab is left out altogether depending on the state of the pt. She felt this may create a lag to the ongoing I/O trials that are using this as a comparator."

The biggest discrepancy among the AI/ TLs was in the % of patients that KN-024 addresses:
-AI/ TL #1: 30-35%
-AI/ TL #2: closer to 20% (after excluding EGFR and ALK patients) ? just slightly more than the percentage of patients with EGFR mutation
-Remainder thought the number was between 25-30%
Rescanning:
-AI/ TL#3: Q6W for Pembro in 1L (~ to chemo rescanning)
-AI/ TL #2: Q9W for Pembro in 1L, then begin to decrease frequency
KN-021:
-AI/ TL #4: doesn?t believe that this will be adopted. There doesn?t seem to be an OS benefit, so why would PFS benefit matter

From the podium, he also made the following comments:
?	AI showed the KN 024 data:
o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery."

This has the potential difficulty of pushback from insurance companies. Alternatively, she tries to get them onto an open trial that has genomic testing included in their entry requirements.

Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients."

"[nivolumab, cabozantinib, patients receiving]"," 02-27-2016

An NCCN panelist for renal cell carcinoma explained the rationale for limiting targeted therapy as second line only to patients treated with TKI therapy.  Bevacizumab in combination with interferon is no longer a preferred therapy due to toxicity.  So very few patients are currently started on bevacizumab. Also, in clinical trials for targeted agents such as nivolumab and cabozantinib, there are not enough patients treated with bevacizumab to warrant an explicit recommendation for targeted therapies in this group. Therefor the NCCN Guidelines are unlikely to change it language to include all anti-angiogenic therapies.  However, oncologists should have no concern in using targeted therapies patients previously treated with bevacizumab."

The following insights were gained from a pathologist and medical director of a diagnostics laboratory at large academic institution in NW territory: i) TL believes that rather than a single biomarker (e.g. PD-L1), combination of biomarkers (e.g. immune cell markers) will provide higher precision in predicting response to IO; ii) TL is spearheading efforts in developing multiplex IHC using immune cell markers in CAP/CLIA certified lab; iii) TL is involved in pembrolizumab studies in prostate cancer (PC) setting. Initial study was published and now they are performing larger scale studies in PC; iv) TL is excited about combination therapies (IO + IO and IO + chemo) and believes that these will provide patients with strong therapeutic benefit."

The Executive Director of large community practice in New England solicited the help of BMS improving the value of immune-oncology products to the payers.  He believes that the value-based payment models that interpret cost from a holistic perspective are imminent, in spite of the recent change in political leadership.  He is interested in co-sponsoring educational efforts targeting community physicians particularly those working in emergency rooms.  His goal is to ensure that family practice/ER physicians diagnose immune-mediated adverse events in patients receiving IO therapy and treat them appropriately to avoid preventable AE-related costs of IO agents.  He was very positive about the ancillary customer support for reimbursement, compassionate use and medical information he receives from BMS."

During a lung cancer symposium in the southeast region, Joseph Ritchie and I gathered the following unsolicited opinions from 5 NCCN panelists or NTLs regarding the evolving NSCLC management landscape, with particular focus on KN-024, CM-026, and PD-L1 testing.
Unanimous that even without cross-trial comparison, Nivo, Pembro, and Atezo have comparable efficacy in 2L.
?	When asked how to decide which of  the 3 checkpoint inhibitors to use in 2L:
-AI/ TL #1: no real differences and you?re going to use the drug ?you grew up with??those like him that participated in Nivo trials will likely stick with Nivo because of familiarity
-AI/ TL #2: no testing and most convenient
1) doesn?t need more paperwork and will avoid filling out forms to test, which eliminates Pembro from consideration
2) Q3W > Q2W, so will use Atezo over Nivo
-AI/ TL #3: PD-1s ORR generally better than PD-L1s ORR, even though comparable OS"
"[intrigued, ""profound"", elaborate]"," 07-14-2016

Met with a NSCLC national AI/TL advisor to NCCN panelist, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.

?	She proactively brought up that she supports distinguishing PDL1 expression levels in treatment decisions and applying data thresholds to what's studied. 
?	She thinks community oncologists don't understand the point above and need to be educated that PD1 agent decisions should follow the data available for specific threshold expression levels studied and that efficacy results are not necessarily equivalent and translatable for different agents studied at different expression levels.
?	AI thinks that the NCCN should delineate in terms of distinguishing recommendations based on the efficacy/safety data available for specific PDL1 expression thresholds studied, which would help to educate the community and prevent confusion that all agents and expression levels are necessarily equal.
?	AI shared that she thinks Merck has not been active to educate community about above point. She gave example that if a patient is positive for PDL1 expression greater than 50%, then you can apply that specific data to treatment decisions, but not if that?s not the patient you have.
?	She thinks BMS needs to provide better education about how to manage patients with immune AE's in patients who are refractory to steroid management.  
o	For example, for a patient on Nivo who experiences immune mediated pneumonitis or colitis AE?s who is refractory to steroids, there needs to be better data to support how to best manage that patient with infliximab.  
?	She thinks that in 1L, it?s absolutely critical to test for PDL1 and there?s a need to educate community docs about this distinction from the 2L setting, where a test may not be needed for decisions.
?	She currently doesn't test for PDL1 in 2L.
?	AI was familiar with 012 and 032 and says she has used Nivo/Ipi for patients who are not candidates for chemo (she didn?t elaborate further).
?	She says that she has many patients experiencing that prolonged duration of response tail on Nivo.
?	AI feels that patients on PD1 treatment who don't have a response are often patients whose disease is really already progressing despite treatment with the PD1.  She feels that this explains the sometimes unimpressive PFS seen in trials like 057.
?	She says the above scenario is different than when a patient is treated with chemo because nothing is suppressing the immune system in patients who are non-responders to Nivo and thus they progress rapidly.  In contrast, chemo patients are still experiencing some suppression of their immune system, so we see some response.
?	Thus, she says OS is the better evaluator of a PD1 agent, not PFS, nor ORR which is just the fastest endpoint.
?	She cautions a need to wait for phase 3 1L trials to compare against chemo, and that phase 1 trials like 012 have a small N (patients).  
?	AI feels that PDL1 testing needs to be standardized and be able to be easily performed at providers? own institutions, instead of being hard to access and having a gamut of different tests."

o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same

?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse

"[decline, mostly, rapidly]"," 11-10-2016

Met with a regional lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that the impact in CM 026 of the Nivo subgroup having a high percentage (37%) of patients having been previously treated with radiotherapy is unclear in whether it contributed to the failure to hit PFS.  
o	It could represent the fact that the Nivo group was a sicker patient population, stacking the deck against the reaching the PFS primary endpoint.  
o	Alternatively, there are some studies that show a hypothesis for potentiation of response to IO therapy when patients are treated with IO post-radiation, due to increase in neo-antigen response.  
o	The key is the temporal relationship of IO after radiation.  
?	She was surprised with the lack of PFS advantage at PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% since she believes that the PD1 agents (Nivo, Pembro) are not different.  We proceeded to review the lack of PDL1 50% or greater stratification of populations, which evidences that the study was not designed to read out PFS for this population, as well as imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression populations as possible contributing factors.  
?	AI thinks the failure has to do with the CM 026 study design, again referencing the fact that she doesn?t believe Nivo and Pembro are different, which leads her to believe that the study design lead to divergent results in KN 024 and CM 026.
?	AI says that this is just a stage on the way to combos and this stage will pass.  She believes this will be the relevant landscape instead of monotherapy.
?	AI believes that at a major cancer center like hers, q3w dosing of Atezo in 2L is an important consideration that may push treatment towards Atezo, since many patients come from far-away places via referrals, which is a big motivator for having a q3w regimen for these patients."

?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.
o	He referenced the above discussed imbalances in patient population and the lack of stratification of subgroups as possible explanations of the negative result, along with possibly bad luck.
o	He said that we need to hold off judgment until the combo data is available."

o	Emphasized had OS, which he didn't expect due to the percentage of crossover.
o	The percentage of crossover was lower than he expected, which may explain that survival advantage.
o	In the study, smoking status was an important prognostic indicator, more than PDL1 status (showed KN subgroup PFS HR slide).
o	Once patients had over PDL1 50% expression, it didn't further impact their PFS since the expression level was high enough already.
?	In regards to CM 026, he stated that the negative result was not the end of the story, as monotherapy is only a step towards future combo therapies.
?	He referenced the importance of value in medicine.  Since IO therapies such as Nivo, Ipi, and Nivo-Ipi are expensive, there is an increased need to be able to optimize and be smarter about their use, leveraging tools such as PDL1 bio markers to make decisions.  These actions may actually increase value by bringing and increasing survival, which improves value overall.
?	AI said that sequencing of therapy is an important strategy to improve survival, such as using targeted therapy in the right way before even thinking about IO or chemo.  
?	He wouldn't use mutation burden as a factor to make treatment decisions at this time, since the science is not mature yet.
?	He said there's some weak anecdotal data out there that providers should be concerned with patients being more likely to have pneumonitis if they've had radiation before PD1, or surgery."

"[cHL, mentioned, volunteered]"," 06-28-2016

Heather Copher-Sweeney and I recently met with a NTL/ Lymphoma NCCN panelist from an NCI-designated academic institution to discuss the role of I-O in the treatment of cHL. The panelist offered the following insights:
Panelist use of I-O in treating HL:
  ? Has been using Nivo in the treatment of lymphoma for a while, and is very comfortable with its MoA and AE profile.
  ? Has used Nivo compassionate use almost exclusively in patients post-BV that never received an aSCT (due to not being candidates). 
  ? Has not had a Nivo patient since launch, and only treats lymphoma patients, the majority of which are RR patients. 
  ? Reported has only had experience with Nivo (no pembro use)
  ? When the discussion of post-Opdivo allo-SCT arose, this panelist shared that patients receiving immunosuppressants would not receive I-O, at least until it?s better understood
    ? Experienced one GVHD death due to autoimmune hepatitis 
    ?	Requested med info regarding use post- allo (Herbaux et al data was reviewed and med info request for abstract was sent)
  ? Opportunities for I-O in HL:
        o Doesn?t believe ceiling for treatment of HL has been reached. Sees unmet need in 2L, and believes that I-O can challenge high-dose chemos, like ICE with better outcomes and less toxicity
    ?  Sees the 1L therapies firmly entrenched
Bleomycin shortage:
  ? Was recently informed by institution?s pharmacy that they were having difficulty obtaining Bleomycin and had a limited supply, so panelist should think about who really needs it
  ? Participated in BV+AVD study, and thinks the results aren?t just useful during this Bleomycin shortage
      o Has a BV+AD (minus bleomycin and vinblastine) trial open, and would even look to more actively place patients on that trial if bleomycin shortage continues indefinitely
Checkmate 205:
  ? The panelist had not seen the data for 205 that had been presented at ASCO. Upon presentation of the data, the panelist responded favorably, (i.e., reacting as if it were comparable to expectations).
New NCCN Guidelines:
  ? The panelist was unaware that the updated guidelines had already been published, and asked what changes were finally made. This panelist remembered having received an email from NCCN the day earlier but hadn?t yet read it and hadn?t seen the new guidelines.
    o When we listed the changes, the panelist seemed surprised that there weren?t additional changes. The panelist mentioned that the most recent TC of NCCN panelists was almost entirely devoted to Nivo, and was surprised that the category wasn?t changed for Nivo. The panelist couldn?t understand why Nivo was left in same category with Pembro (that has less data, no meaningful publication, or FDA approval)."
"[refractory, observed, frequency]"," 06-20-2016

BMS Attendees: Cynthia Chan (MSL), Tony Wang (HSL)
 
Met with a Head and Neck national/regional NCCN panelist AI/TL, during which AI/TL shared the following unsolicited insights.
?	He says for locally advanced setting, he chooses based upon if the patient is fit or not. If he is, he uses cisplatin with concurrent radiation, but also could be other treatments, which he terms the ?wild west?, meaning other treatment options are on the table as well.
?	If the patient has had platinum prior, he could try a single taxane as next treatment.  
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, if the patient is fit, he prefers to use PTC (platinum/taxane/cetuximab), instead of the EXTREME regimen.  
?	He said that part of the reason he believes in PTC instead of EXTREME is because the 5-FU in the EXTREME regimen leads to a bad toxicity profile.
?	He says the only reason the EXTREME regimen included 5-FU instead of a taxane was because the investigator Vemorken was in Belgium where taxane was not approved in this indication.
?	In the recurrent/metastatic setting, he uses a PD1 inhibitor after the PTC regimen.
?	If the patient is not fit in the recurrent/metastatic setting, he?ll go directly to a PD1 inhibitor.
?	He says he was involved in BMS head and neck early trials and believes that BMS got it wrong by not pursuing every 3 week dosing, instead of every 2 week dosing.  
?	He said he starts most patients on pembrolizumab solely because it is more convenient for the patient with less frequency of dosing.  He believes BMS should pursue strategy of investigating less frequent dosing.  
?	In the recurrent metastatic setting, he never uses cetuximab single agent, due to the low response rate.
?	He says he stratifies patients in terms of sensitivity to platinum.  If patient progressed on platinum 6 months to 1 year ago, he considers them refractory and does not use platinum again.  
?	If a patient progressed and had platinum 2 years ago, he might try platinum again.  
?	He expressed that an area of H&N research gap is how to utilize PD1 agents in incurable patients who do not have a response to initial PD1 therapy."

RTL who splits time between Academic GU specialists and community generalist shared the following RE: PDL1 testing in Bladder cancer

-  that he is confused by all the different variations of testing being used by different agents in bladder (tumor cell, immune cell, different cutoffs).
- very intrigued why PDL1 expression doesn't seem to impact nivo response, however does seem to impact response to Atezo, Durva, and Pembro).  Wonders if it is an assay effect or an actual drug effect.  He believes assay, as the 'patterns of enrichment by PDL1 in other tumor types has remained consistent across drugs"""

Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo

Attended a personalized lung therapies conference post-ESMO where a national lung AI/TL provided the following unsolicited insights from the podium.
?	In response to discussion of why the CM 026 trial would be negative when the KN 024 trial was positive, he stated that?
o	The CM trial had an overly broad patient population in terms of the primary PFS endpoint.  
o	He expressed that it was hard to reconcile why the PDL1 greater than or equal to 50% subgroup had a negative result.  I had an opportunity to meet with AI and explain to him that the study was not designed to test PFS at greater than or equal to 50%.  Also, due to imbalances in patient populations, including PDL1 expression levels between the 2 groups and imbalances in sex, PFS at this subgroup was not within the trial design.  
o	He stated that the negative result shakes the prior belief that agents are the same.
o	He referenced the above discussed imbalances in patient population and the lack of stratification of subgroups as possible explanations of the negative result, along with possibly bad luck.
o	He said that we need to hold off judgment until the combo data is available."

"[convenient, comfort, folks]"," 10-23-2016

A couple of regional lung TLs commented that while they're not nearly as familiar with atezo data/history of development, the fact that it is now proven to work in a similar population as nivo in the 2L (all comers regardless of PDL1 expression), it will be an attractive option because of the Q3W dosing, particularly for those traveling a fair amount to be treated. While this institution doesn't find this to be common for NSCLC, it may only take a few for physicians to get more comfortable with the more convenient dosing that could then be used for more of their patients in general."
"[screening, pushing, delivered]"," 10-17-2016

CRC RTL shared that he thought a better trial and registrational strategy would be that instead of screening for MSI-high patient populations, screen for high mutational load. He shared that he using Foundation Medicine diagnostic test for most CRC patients and that he sees MSI high patients about 5% of the time and high mutational load patients about 25% of the time. He further shared that he has been using Nivolumab and pembro off-label  in these patients and has seen some responses.

?	At this point in time, VIA pathway not yet implemented for his organization, but he has access to the VIA ?sandbox? so he is able to access the system and has knowledge of pathways for tumor types.
?	In regards to SCLC, he reactively disclosed that the pathway has been updated recently after the update of the NCCN guidelines (inclusion of regimen as option in 2L).
?	AI said that Nivo is on pathway for NSCLC.  If a patient does not have a PDL1 test, it?s unknown, or the test shows a low or non-expressor, then Nivo is the choice.  
?	The pathway asks if a NSCLC patient has a positive PDL1 test, without referring to specific PDL1 thresholds.  If it?s positive, then Keytruda is offered.  If it?s negative, Opdivo is offered.  
?	He mentioned that VIA pathway adherence goal is 80% for his organization (didn?t specific whether this is target across tumors or is goal for each tumor type).
?	He says VIA pathway is provider centric, which is useful in community practices, and less useful in an academic setting where providers are more familiar with SOC and understand the data.

The following insights were gleaned from an NCCN NSCLC panelist in the Midwest institution

?	After reviewing the 026 deck, AI commented that the study design was flawed. She stated they were really hoping for Nivo in an all comers population in the 1L.
?	A discussion around the discussant?s (Soria) comments/tweets at ESMO when he compared the trials (we confirmed that you can?t compare data across trials, but can look at differences in trials)
o	Differences in trial designs (CM026/KN 024)  and imbalances were discussed (never smokers, PDL1 expression differences, non-stratified PDL1 expression, cross over rates, females, health of pt pop). We discussed that Soria stated only ~10-15% of the patients in the real world would match the patient population in KN 024. 
?	This led to the question of why BMS designed their trial this way. She stated she is accustomed to BMS having stronger trials. 
?	Panelist confirmed that females do better in her experience
?	Panelist is aware of ICER, but is not participating in the review. 
?	In a reactive discussion around the NCCN guidelines, I explained BMS? stance that we do not think Nivo should be placed in the guidelines based on the science. She stated she?s heard in the community that people want to begin to use it in the 1L setting due to decreased toxicity. She?s unsure how they will get paid. She agreed with BMS request to not be in the guidelines as their institution and BMS align in their EBM thinking.
?	AI stated the biggest unmet need for patients with 1L lung cancer is to provide an effective therapy with minimal toxicity to patients with poor PS. She stated that?s were I/O can really show it?s benefit. 012 and 227 design were reactively discussed. She?s excited about 227. 
?	She stated there?s a big education gap on the side of the patient. She feels patients are still trying to push through their IMAR. 
?	AI stated she orders both the Pembro/Nivo assays when doing PDL1 expression testing. Discussion on FDA blue print ensued. She stated, in her experience, patients rarely test for >50%. 
?	She brought up OAK being an all comers population. She didn?t comment further, and only stated, we?ll have to see if the FDA gives them an indication.
?	When asked how this data changes her practice, AI closed with, ?I will use Pembro in 1L in healthy patients who are high expressers and Nivo in 2L for all comers who have not had Pembro.?"

A discussion with a NCCN NSCLC panelist/chair led to the following unsolicited insights and feedback:
-	The panelist highlighted how well he believed BMS data was represented at this year?s ASCO, but added that there are more players/competition in this space. He also made reference to Merck?s press release, but did not mention having seen the data at this time.
-	He shared the NCCN NSCLC panel will be meeting LIVE in Philadelphia in early July, at which time he believes there will be great discussion/debate around the data presented at ASCO.
-	The discussion around the BMS 1st line 012 data was brought up by the panelist in an unsolicited manner, and he highlighted he was extremely impressed with ORR seen in the patient population with >50% PDL1 expression level, but he added that this does not represent a large majority of patients, and he was also concerned about the toxicity. At this time we discussed the ORR across all patient populations in the trial, focusing on the >1% and >5% populations, as well as the safety profile from the 012. We discussed traditional response rates with SOC agents in the first line, focusing on platinum doublet chemo, and the toxicities associated with these agents. AS he believes nivolumab to be a very safe drug in the second line, he was impressed to see the safety profile with the regimen combination, particularly discontinuation rates, being similar across the arms of the study. However, throughout the discussion he mentioned several times the fact that this is a phase 1 trial with very small numbers. At this point we discussed how the NCCN panels view data, highlighting that in the past they have considered adding agents to the guidelines based on P1 data in small patient populations.
-	Given the unmet need for these patients and the response rates/safety profiles discussed, the panelist recommended that we ensure all the NSCLC panelists are familiar with these data.
-	He had unsolicited questions around when our P3 single agent nivo vs chemo data will read out, along with any planned publications for either that data, or any of the data recently presented at ASCO."

Met with a national lung AI/TL post-ESMO, who provided the following unsolicited insights.
?	AI stated that he, along with his institutional colleagues, can?t come to a convincing hypothesis about why CM 026 failed to hit its primary endpoint PFS.
?	AI noted that he is even more puzzled by why there was no signal in PDL1>50% subgroup, despite the noted demographic imbalances in sex and PDL1 expression levels between groups.  Reminded AI that CM 026 was not designed or powered to read out a result in this subgroup, partly due to imbalances and lack of stratification of PDL1 expression (eg. 88 patients in nivo group PDL1>50% versus ~120 in chemo group)
?	He thinks the failure to hit primary endpoint PFS (at 5% or greater) has to do with the trial design in CM 026.
?	He noted that Nivo will still be SOC in other tumors, such as RCC.
?	In 2L lung, Nivo is likely to lose market share simply due to the fact that Atezo has efficacy in an all comer population and most importantly is Q3 weeks instead of Q2 weeks with Nivo."

Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?

?	AI was aware of CM 026 failure to meet its primary endpoint of PFS.

TL stated current treatment paradigm is:
Patients whose tumor is 0-49% (+) will get a platinum doublet.  Will not re-order PD-L1 test if near 50%  (in hopes it comes back >50%) but does not believe insurance is a barrier if they tried to push it.
For patients who get a Platinum doublet and progress, will only recommend a PD-1 inhibitor if the initial PD-L1 testing is 1-49% (+).  The TL feels that chemotherapy is still a slightly better option for the PD-L1 zero patients"

Physician at larger rural practice noted disappointment at lack of responses seen in lung patients receiving Nivolumab.  Discussed with him the line of therapy he has noted this in.  He acknowledged that the majority of these patients were 3rd line and beyond.  He then also noted that he does not do PDL-1 testing on these patients and felt that it might have been he was treating more lower expressors and this may also contribute to what he is perceiving as fewer beneficial responses.  Overall, he has been very happy with the lack of side effects seen with treatment.
Same physician also noted he has started a patient on Regimen who had progressed on Nivolumab mono therapy.  Reviewed algorithms for monitoring and IMAR management as this is his first patient on Regimen.  Also reviewed with the clinic's NP and nursing staff."

a). The study did not include a treatment group with Nivolumab at 3 mg/kg. 
 b). We should compare Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W vs Nivolumab 3mg/kg Q3W in randomized fashion.

I attended the APSHO (Advanced Practitioner Society for Hematology and Oncology) JADPRO conference. Some impressions:
General presentation of immunotherapy: TL for Fox Chase presented the question: are Checkpoint Antibodies Interchangeable?  And answered, ""no meaningful clinical differences (within class) to date."" 
Head and Neck:  TL from Dana-Farber presented data from KN-012, noted it was approved on Phase 1 data based on ORR. Then presented CM 141, stressed that it was the first phase 3 data with primary endpoint of OS and approval was imminent.  Also stressed the favorable PROs noted on this study. He currently has a patient receiving Nivolumab that is responding well despite comorbidity of Hepatitis C. IMAR management presented, only unusual comment was IO agent held or discontinued for Grade 3-4 hyperthyroidism.
Myeloma: presented data on ELOQUENT-2: overall impressions for Elotuzimab good in efficacy and SE profile. Daratumumab results exciting though noted cytopenias.  Stressed higher incidence of infusion reactins in Dara.
NSCLC: TL and NP presented Nivo data in 2L first, remarking on differences in squamous vs nonsquamous in regards to PD-L1 expression., though all pts showed response and  testing not necessary. Stressed pembro with same indication in 2L but approved for  PDL1+  pts only. Remarked how exciting it is that pembro approved in 1L for pts with PD-L1 > 50%, though failed to mention the percentage of lung cancer pts that high expression represented. I did point out the low percentage in the Q&A, which prompted an add-on discussion that there was more to be done in 1L."

Brian Carriere and I met with a NTL/ NSCLC NCCN panelist at an NCI-designated academic institution in the mid-Atlantic who volunteered these unsolicited views regarding the rapidly evolving NSCLC treatment landscape:
Current Immunotherapy landscape:
?	This panelist believes that because of the MoA, anti-PD1s will eventually be seen as interchangeable, and believes that payers will prefer whichever pharma/ biotech company?s therapy is most cost-effective
o	Upon review of Keynote-010 versus Checkmate 057 mOS and HR to illustrate outcome differences, panelist pointed out BMS omitting Squamous NSCLC
?	Believes that the difference (if any) is negligible when introducing Squamous population in to Checkmate data
?	Acknowledges that BMS is dominating in 2L market share because of no testing strategy
o	As long as new efficacy and safety data matches Merck?s and timing of indications is roughly the same, panelist believes BMS will maintain its lead in 1L because oncologists are accustomed to using Nivo and habits are difficult to break
I-O shift to first line:
?	Awaiting Merck to release results of Keynote-024
o	Expects presentation of data at ESMO, and hopes to see BMS present findings from Checkmate-026 at that time
o	Understands why BMS would be a little anxious after Merck?s most recent press release, but views Keynote-024 as only impacting 15% (at best) of NSCLC because of its PD-L1 >50% requirement
?	Review of Checkmate-012:
o	Panelist expressed befuddlement at amount of press Checkmate-012 garnered post-ASCO considering how few patients were involved in trial 
?	Appreciated the 57% versus 28% ORR in PD-L1 expressers in the Nivo+Ipi versus Nivo mono groups, respectively, and found it impactful
?	Expressed concern with combination of Nivo+Ipi because of its toxicity profile
?	Upon review of Checkmate-012 safety data, panelist acknowledged that 19% versus 33% Grade 3-4 AEs was NOT drastically different, and 13% versus 10% and 8% versus 10% discontinuation rates for all Grade AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, were essentially the same
o	Nevertheless, panelist mentioned multiple times throughout meeting that Ipi was toxic 
?	Bryan and I then differentiated Nivo+Ipi dosing in melanoma versus NSCLC, stressing small Ipi dose of 1mg/kg in NSCLC
o	Panelist mentioned at least twice that Nivo+Ipi should only be used in a clinical trial setting and not in a community setting
?	When asked what evidence/ data is missing to calm safety concerns, panelist responded that BMS would need much more safety data than what was presented on 30+ patients
?	Expressed how often Phase 1 data can?t be replicated in a Phase 3 setting
PD-L1 testing:
?	Does not believe that PD-L1 is an accurate marker of disease in NSCLC
o	This panelist believes that too much time is spent on PD1 inhibitors in NSCLC when PD-L1 doesn?t fully explain disease outcome
?	Adamantly believes that someone will one day be able to explain how NSCLC can best be managed, and doesn?t believe PD-1 will be a relevant factor
?	Doesn?t believe that anyone in the community practice setting cares about PD-L1 levels for treatment
o	Community oncologists only want to know PD-L1 cutoffs so that they know what to prescribe in order for payers to reimburse
?	This will become less of an issue when Merck is also indicated for all PD-L1 expressers
Payers and NCCN:
?	Mentioned that several NCCN panel members had received angry and disturbing letters from payers when NCCN had decided to include testing for use of Pembro because it added to payer?s expenses 
?	Laughed at the idea that payers and pathway companies use guidelines to create their medical policies when guidelines are only meant to be one group?s opinion
?	When asked about how NCCN would communicate PD-L1 cutoffs for therapeutic recommendations, (i.e., Checkmate-012 presentation where Nivo+Ipi PD-L1 status cutoff was 1% but Nivo monotherapy cutoff in Gettinger paper was 5% ), the panelist mentioned similarly to what they?ve done in the past for Pembro
o	This panelist believes that NCCN panel has gone far enough in clearly stating Pembro?s required testing and cutoff in the Guidelines, and doesn?t need additional or more forceful language
Financial Concerns:
?	This panelist says that Nivo?s introduction and applicability across tumor types is unprecedented in oncology, and that its cost as it continues to gain indications is unsustainable to the healthcare system
o	Several times used the term ?financially toxic? to describe the cost of Nivo+Ipi 
?	Recently co-authored and submitted a commentary to Francisco Tartari?s article on economic stability of PD1 inhibitors - Economic sustainability of anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab in cancer patients: Recent insights and future challenges, where calculated cost of Nivo was $44k and Pembro was $130k: (http://www.cancertreatmentreviews.com/article/S0305-7372(16)30041-X/abstract)"

Met with a national/regional lung AI and NCCN NSCLC Panelist, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI favors idea of separating efficacy data by PDL1 expression thresholds, but he says the picture is not telling yet, and understands that PDL1 expression is a wide spectrum instead of being binary.
?	He says there still needs to be more efficacy trials done evaluating specific data in different PDL1 populations, before the NCCN would add clarifiers on the guidelines around PDL1.  Reactively mentioned the mOS comparisons from 057 at the 1, 5, and 10% PDL1 thresholds, showing higher response with higher levels of expression.
?	He?s unsure of the role of PDL1 in mesothelioma, due to lack of studies in this area.
?	He says he is transitioning NSCLC focus to his colleague at his institution, as he is transitioning his research focus to mesothelioma.
?	He thinks combo IO therapy and IO combos with chemo both are promising strategies, but not sure which combo strategy is the better one, but he is encouraged by promising early response like that seen in CM 012 with Nivo and KN trials.  
?	In terms of the 012 data, he prefers the Ipi Q6h dosing regimen due to lower rate of AE?s seen.
?	He thinks that the CM 026 failure to hit PFS is not telling yet.  It actually makes PDL1 thresholds more important.
?	It may tell us of the need to apply efficacy data to certain PDL1 enriched populations."

Met with a regional RCC/melanoma AI for a major regional health system, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI expressed interest in value comparison of regimen versus Nivo monotherapy in melanoma.  Reactively shared HEOR regimen versus Nivolumab monotherapy slides, showing that the cost of regimen versus monotherapy in melanoma is only 6% higher with regimen compared to monotherapy.  
?	He expressed that he prefers to use regimen rather than monotherapy, due to the heightened efficacy.  
?	He expressed that he has encountered access hurdles when prescribing regimen for Oregon Medicare patients, while he has not encountered such hurdles for monotherapy.
?	He expressed that he has seen reluctance with community docs in initiating steroid treatment of immune AE?s, due to fear of suppressing immune system concurrently.  When community docs have reached out, he has been relaying the message that this is not the case in the stage where patients are developing immune AE?s after the initiation period and that steroids can be effectively used to manage immune AE?s when they occur.  
?	Reactively shared with AI the Checkmate 069 ASCO analysis showing similar clinical benefit in terms of OS/PFS at 2 years, which reinforced AI?s belief in the prolonged duration of therapy seen with Nivo, and reinforces value equation of regimen."

Biomedical Learning Institute 1st Annual Symposium on Integrating Immune Therapies & Target Therapies into Standards of Care for Heme and Solid Malignancies; San Fran Sept 10, 2016 
Well Attended with over 200 attendees/ Merck was a sponsor as well as other companies (foundation medicine).   BMS was not one of the major sponsors.  

Lung: One of the major questions was: Are antiPD-1 agents interchangeable, and the presenters overall argued for yes they are the same (nivo/pembro). The schedule differences were mentioned several times highlighting Pembro
Insights 
?	Oak Trial results were mentioned for Atezo (Atezo was alleged as More toxic of the agents)
?	Pembro and Nivo have same toxicity profile
?	We don?t need a cross trial comparison since the populations were very similar and Nivo performs regardless of pd staining percentages
?	Commented that there are so many duplicative 2nd line trials amongst PD-1 inhibitors.  There is pressure to move into front line setting.  
?	In reference to 1st line lung press releases ? ?Merck cherry picked their patients? for trial, and consensus was that no doc on panel board would use off label 1st line IO tx unless on trial, they are all waiting for data; they all concluded that BMS strategy in 1st line did not pay off, and chemo ?isn?t going anywhere?, since only 50% of pts likely have pd expression. One TL did comment that if he did he would use Pembro as the data is there and it has the best schedule. 
?	Awaiting Blueprint project for further information on which testing to use (docs agreed that most facilities will pick one test and use exclusively due to cost and training)
?	All panel board docs advised audience to get PD status on new dx pts.  The question was asked if testing should be mandatory for newly diagnosed patients and they all said yes.  
?	National TL discussed Nivo trial looking at OS by PDL1 expression and stated 10% had better OS and that PDL-1 staining does predict OS. 
?	A lot of excitement over Ipi/Nivo combo in Lung  
1.	Mentioned that it is very alluring to give a boost of Ipi when single agent IO is fizzling to boost responses (no data to support however)
?	*Pseudoprogression mentioned many times ?does not exist in lung? ?pts refuse to be taken off of tx even in the face of wild progression?
?	Mentioned BMS 153 trial looking at early stopping of tx  Discussed the need to look at how long to continue these therapies.  TL went on to say he wasn?t sure how the data would pan out with this trial since many patients don?t survive to 1 year which is the cutoff for the trial to continue without therapy.
Costs: Cost was mentioned many times with one quote from podium for Lung 1st Line ?The only thing more expensive than IO is IO combo? 


Melanoma: Dr. J. Weber was one of the 2 presenters- NTL 
*Discussed BRAF pts to use targeted or IO first line setting (no consensus, both sides argued)
*Weber alleged Ipi/Nivo regimen is ?very toxic? and ?very effective? tx. Targeted Tx?s are less toxic that Combo IO. 
*advised audience to use 8 weeks of Targeted tx and move on to regimen of ipi/nivo
*Tvec treatment cant compare to IO
*064 Trial highlighted as switch approach 
*Encouraged extrapolating data from Lung Trial 012 for melanoma and to use reversed dosing or Ipi Q6w or Q12w
*believes adding braf inh target tx to IO combo will be very effective

TL mentioned that there has been a substantial increase in PD-L1 test requests since 1L approval of Keytruda 
2. They have the 22C3 Dako pharmDx assay standardized in-house
3. When asked about reporting format, he said that they report % tumor cells stained. They do not give a range nor do they suggest whether the % staining seen would make the patient eligible/ineligible for a given I/O therapy
4. When asked about how the Medoncs might interpret the result, he said that in 1L the medoncs are leaning towards keytruda when the % staining is anywhere more than 30%. He says that they are well aware of the >_50% cut-off for keytruda. According to him, the medoncs want to offer I/O to as many patients as possible, thereby not adhering strictly to the pdl1 cut-offs. 
5. Test requests at this institution never specify if the tissue is from a 1L or 2L setting. Pathologists do not want to know this as they do not want to make treatment eligibility decisions for the patients. Therefore they are avoiding mentioning that keytruda use in 1L requires PD-L1 staining of more than 50%."

Most requests are on label, but says he gets requests for all tumor types. If they get a request that is off-label, they will state that the test is not approved in that tumor type. Accepts cytology and FNA samples without any disclaimer; believes that as long as there are 100 tumor cells, it's on label.

"[institution, regional, KN-024]"," 06-17-2016

Met with a regional melanoma AI, who provided the following unsolicited insights:
?	AI mentioned that he is part of his institutional team that is looking at developing a home-grown treatment algorithm in terms of IO treatments.
?	This algorithm would take into account patient specific factors, such as patient?s performance status, and also baseline labs.  
?	It would define an algorithm in terms of class of agents, such as PD1 inhibitors, instead of be product specific.
?	AI currently does not test for PDL1 status prior to treatment initiation.
?	AI mentioned that he still considers individual patient specific characteristics in deciding whether to start on Nivo monotherapy versus regimen, such as performance status.
?	AI defines current practice in terms of nivolumab as 60% of patients getting monotherapy and 40% getting regimen.
?	He describes some anecdotal experience of seeing patients respond to regimen after not seeing a response on initial Pembro treatment.  He quantified that 1 out of 5 patients, he might see this type of occurrence.
?	When issue of cost arose, was able to reinforce with AI that the cost of regimen is only incrementally more expensive, around 6%, higher than the cost of sequential ipi followed by nivo.  
?	Reinforced with AI that the true cost of regimen treatment needs to take into account that 57% of patients in 069 received median number of doses (the full combo portion of treatment) and that only around 14% of patients were treated for 1 year.  
?	Broadened AI?s consideration of true cost parameters, as evidenced by his agreement that this needs to be considered in terms of true cost of regimen.  
?	In response to his question about sequential therapy, shared that nivo followed by ipi, as well as the reverse sequential regimens, did not show as good efficacy or more favorable AE profile compared to regimen.  
?	AI referenced his institution?s goal of conducting outcomes studies, in melanoma and beyond.  Offered connecting AI with BMS HEOR colleague to explore potential collaboration.
?	AI expressed that he was not particularly wowed with any melanoma data shared at ASCO 2016, as they were mostly comprised of updates on previously published studies."

NTL in NSCLC shared thoughts around aPD1+RT combination and abscopal effect.  
- Thinks that this is likely a 'real' phenomenon, but that there will have to be fine tuning to make it useful.  States that data is emerging (cited MD Anderson to soon report their findings) that high dose RT is immuno-suppressive, while pulsed low dose RT is immuno-stimulatory (and thus, how RT+IO combos studies should be designed).  

TL also stated, that for pallative RT outside of the lung field (brain, bone, cutaneous, etc) he has no concern around increased toxicity with IO and gives them concurrently without holding PD1 doses as in trials (ie nivo trials had 1 week b/f, week of, 1 wk after hold if pallative RT needed)."

Having missed ASCO this year, an access influencer, radiation oncologist, and new NCCN panelist for NSCLC at a large academic institution in the HSL South territory asked on 08/05/16 to review Checkmate 012 data. The bar chart describing ORR with nivo (nivo+ipi) across tumor PD-L1 expression levels captured his attention (?nivo is truly a cool drug?). He commended BMS for studying nivo (nivo+ipi) efficacy across the entire range of PD-L1 expression, acknowledging that (many of) our competitors seemed reluctant to assume the risks associated with this strategy. He also noted that: 1) ORR values with nivo (nivo+ipi) at the ?50% expression level were most impressive; 2) ORR values at the <1% - ?1% levels were not negligible, even in comparison which ORR achieved with platinum-based chemotherapy; 3) nivo (nivo+ipi) may prove to be the best therapeutic options for some categories of patients with low PD-L1 expressing tumors (e.g., older or frail patients); 4) the medical community desperately needs more data to make informed decisions about who should receive what.  
The AI did not know the results of Checkmate 026. We did not address the issue since BMS official talking points had not yet been released."

RCC TL and I discussed recent approvals of Cabo and Lenvantinib versus Nivo and how they all will fit into the treatment landscape.  He stated in rapidly progressing pts or pts with significant burden of disease he may go with Cabo. We reactively we reviewed the data from the Motzer ASCO GU presentation discussing outcomes based on key baseline therapies that overall describes the superiority of Nivo in all pt subgroups including poor prognostic risk categories, number/sites of mets, and prior therapies.  We also discussed the dynamics of response with TKIs versus IO agents like nivolumab specifically durability of response and consistent OS advantage across phase 3 studies.  He was impressed with data and stated Nivo is 2nd line SOC in all subgroups plus the toxicity profile for Nivo is far superior to other agents.  This seemed to solidify his preference of Nivo over Cabo in all pts including rapidly progressing pt pop.  Tl was not impressed with Lenvantinb and thought it had significant toxicities in combo with everolimus (late line option)."

o	Checkpoint inhibition is relevant biologically
o	Sophisticated pre-clinical testing in animal models demonstrated biologic relevance
o	PDL1+ expressers demonstrate higher response in many different cancers
?	057 KM curves by PDL1 show higher response for higher expressers
?	017 not same, but different beast
?	012 shows higher response in higher expressors
o	the problem is not PDL1 (a good test), it?s Pharma that has confused with different cuts of data, etc.
o	PDL1 (life cycle of PDL1 as biomarker), PDL1 testing validated in 1st and 2L NSCLC
o	PD1 oversold as good for everybody, but actually only good for smaller percentages
o	Checkpoint IO only cost effective when they are employed for pts most likely to benefit (defined as predictive biomarker)
?	Testing will save 3.4 billion in US (jokingly)
o	PDL1 measurement by alt. methods (CfRNA) will help measure response.
o	PDL1 testing will become SOC for 1L in advanced NSCLC
o	Can learn from not meeting 026, is different trial than KN

"[TL stated, pathologists, reimbursement]"," 12-14-2016

Path TL states that there were a few 22C3 requests when pembro was approved 1L but once the oncologists were educated in PD-L1 testing they were ok with E1L3N LDT
-TL states that if reimbursement doesn?t care about the antibody or assay then bringing in-house an FDA-approved IVD is not necessary"
"[NCCN, panelist, advisor]"," 10-27-2016

I met with a NCCN NSCLC panelist in the midwest.  He offered these insights

On OAK at ESMO he stated he and the panel viewed the data to be good, roughly like Opdivo.  On the issue of the ESMO data showing ""positive"" results in the PDL-1 negative population, we went over the issues and he stated the panel recently discussed this.  Stated there was not strong enthusiasm of panel for the PDL-1 negative argument due to reasons we discussed internally, but also due to low numbers and at this point unpublished data (he stressed this).  That said given indication of atezo unlikely to get NCCN recommendation more restrictive than label.

Agreed with just about everybody else that 026 was surprise, likely trial design, etc.

On KN 021 stated panel felt the data way to early to recommend Chemo/Pembro in any way.  Had no opinion on whether IO/IO or IO/chemo likely to be superior

Stated NCCN was working on recommendation on how to use PDL-1 cutoffs in some future statement.  This is second NCCN panelist to mention this to me.  Other was in cHL.  Stated majority of effort was in the 1-100% area (as opposed to 0-3+)  Commended BMS for working with Ventana

Noted when voting any member whose name was on relevant paper must recuse self."
"[institution, ~200K, assosicated]"," 05-06-2016

For a small regional health plan assosicated with a national account institution (~200K lives): While discussing oncology management, the payor stated that he is excited to hear that there will be more PD1's enter the market as they will be able to manage the class; however, he stated it will be nearly impossible to manage the class if the indications vary from drug to drug. He cited the example of the TNF class of drugs where they are unable to restrict certain drugs due to niche indications. This specific plan does not currently manage oncology."
"[Merck, lecture, presentation]"," 09-26-2016

A melanoma speaker at a Post-ASCO review who is a Merck speaker, spent 75% of the lecture discussing KN001, KN006 and KN029 data from ASCO.  When discussing KN029, did not mention the commercially available combination of Regimen.  Discussed CK067 but completely undermined activity of Regimen over the two comparators.  Rather highlighted how the two Nivo arms were superior to Yervoy."
