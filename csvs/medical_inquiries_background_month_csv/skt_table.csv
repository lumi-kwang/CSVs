She indicates there is a lot of great information out there but a lot of it is not complete. Some of them only report in more than 10% of patients. Based on their systematic review, there are 3 references that meet their criteria: 1. Checkmate 025- renal cell 2. Nivolumab Phase 2 study- JCO Volume 33 first page is 1430; Nivolumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (I clarified if this was a BMS publication, and she indicated it was sponsored by BMS but published by an independent author). I indicated BMS may not have additional information to share regarding this and indicated she may need to contact the author of the publication for further information. 3. Checkmate 032- nivolumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma which is not published, but there are 2 abstracts available, one from ESMO 2016 and one from ASCO 2016.

She indicates that they are including all PDL-1 inhibitors in the review and are looking for additional information from BMS regarding nivolumab. She indicates there is a lot of great information out there but a lot of it is not complete. Some of them only report in more than 10% of patients. Based on their systematic review, there are 3 references that meet their criteria: 1. Checkmate 025- renal cell 2. Nivolumab Phase 2 study- JCO Volume 33 first page is 1430; Nivolumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (I clarified if this was a BMS publication, and she indicated it was sponsored by BMS but published by an independent author). I indicated BMS may not have additional information to share regarding this and indicated she may need to contact the author of the publication for further information. 3. Checkmate 032- nivolumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma which is not published, but there are 2 abstracts available, one from ESMO 2016 and one from ASCO 2016. The ASCO abstract has more information. So they are using the ASCO abstract- Abstract #4501. She indicates they specifically want immune mediated adverse events.

Name: Mr. Brad Standfer (BS Pharmacist) Address: Access Pharmacy 4062 Hixson Pike Chattanooga, TN 37415 Phone: 423-309-0596 Fax/Email: Not provided. Pharmacist is calling on behalf of his mother, who is considering starting Opdivo therapy. His mother has ""squamous cell carcinoma in her pelvis"" and has been on ""cisplatin and radiation in the past, but they were not effective."" Hence, why they are considering starting Opdivo. He knows that it is ""not indicated for use in squamous cell carcinoma of the pelvis"" and that ""the insurance probably won't pay for it,"" but he is willing to pay out of pocket if we have any data available to support off-label use in this type of patient. Placed caller on hold to do further research. No info found via the PI/SRLs. Informed caller of these findings and offered to take his request offline for further research. Caller confirmed this would be helpful and he would like to be contacted for follow-up via phone. Caller stated that he knows Opdivo ""is indicated for squamous cell carcinoma in the lungs."" Do you have to test the tumor before administering Opdivo to see if certain genetic markers are or are not present, or is this indicated for ALL NSCLC (regardless of these markers)? Advised caller that I will also look into this for him to avoid placing him on hold once more. Caller was appreciative. Explained our normal 2 day turnaround time frame to him, but offered to mark it as time-sensitive (since a patient is involved). Caller confirmed this would be helpful. Caller stated that his mom is 83 years old, she had ""pain in her hip"" and was diagnosed with ""metastatic squamous cell carcinoma."" At that time, she was given ""1-2 years to survive"" and it's already been ""about 1 year now."" She also had the Cyberknife procedure, which did not work. Her doctors have advised that there aren't really any other options to try at this point. But, the pharmacist saw our commercial and wanted to see if Opdivo may be an option (even if it's off-label). Advised caller that we will look into his request and get back to him shortly. Caller had no further questions at this time. Decided to file as AE-Y and PQC-Y for cisplatin after the call ended (to be conservative). This AE report does not appear to be follow-up to any previously reported AEs. Split into 2 requests: - 485089 (off-label portion) - 485186 (tumor testing portion) JJ 07Dec2016 Assigning both requests to US-Oncology Queue (for confirmation of my approach for the first portion and for guidance on the second portion). JJ 08Dec2016 Verbal FAQ on biomarker testing since HCP wants phone fulfillment. States that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker is not required for treatment with nivolumab. CS 08Dec2016 This addresses PD-L1 and mentions ALK and EGFR ( they must have failed previous approved therapy for these genetic mutations) Really would depend on the specific genetic mutation, but the most widely questioned biomarker with nivolumab is the PD-L1 biomarker and testing for this is not required. CS 08Dec2016 Assigning back to JJ for fulfillment. CS 08Dec2016 1st attempt to provide verbal FLMT; left VM with 1-800-321-1335 number and provided Intx # to reference. JJ 08Dec2016 2nd attempt to provide verbal FLMT; left VM with 1-800-321-1335 number and provided Intx # to reference. JJ 12Dec2016 Close out if no response from HCP by EOB on 14Dec2016. No response from HCP. Kept documents attached to the case (to save time in case he calls back). Manually closing this request. JJ 15Dec2016 Lync message from Shelly while I was on break (20Dec2016): ""I have Brad, pharmacist calling you back. Case is 00485186. He said he can be reached for the next 5 hours pretty easily at phone 423-309-0596."" My response (20Dec2016): ""Hi Shelly. Thanks for letting me know. I had already closed out his request, since he never responded. And I have another PQC/AE/FLMT to complete before I leave at 5pm. It will probably be tomorrow before I get a chance to call him back. Thanks!"" Reopened requests. Will follow-up with HCP later this morning. JJ 21Dec2016 Called and spoke with Mr. Brad Standefer (provided OCRD). - Spoke from no-info response to address his first request (485089). Caller mentioned that the oncologist had said ""Opdivo is not indicated for squamous cell in the pelvis."" He told the oncologist that ""it's not going to be indicated for all different locations in the body because it can't feasibly be tested in all parts of the body, but it is a similar type of cancer."" He'd like to ""give his mom an extra 8-9 months if possible"" and will discuss with oncologist. - Spoke from the verbal PTC-Biomarker FAQ document to address his second request regarding testing (485186). Discussed PD-L1 and two other mutations CS listed in chatter message. Caller went on to state ""my mother's oncologist said that her tumor did not test that it would be sensitive to Opdivo."" Is this possible? Is there a test that would automatically rule out Opdivo? Suggesed caller may want to follow-up with the oncologist to clarify which specific test he performed, as we have no way of confirming/denying without this information. Caller confirmed he will discuss further with oncologist. He also asked if we have any information on how patients with positive PD-L1 status did with Opdivo. Confirmed that we have 2 SRLs (Nivolumab-Efficacy of nivolumab by PD-L1 expression in patients with head and neck AND Nivolumab-Nivolumab PD-L1 predictive biomarker in patients with NSCLC). I know he had originally asked about NSCLC, but the head and neck indication may be a more accurate match to his mother's type of cancer. Caller confirmed he would like to receive both SRLs to discuss with the oncologist. Caller had no further questions. Created 3rd request (499646) after the call to address his new question on how patients with PD-L1 positive status did with Opdivo. Created FLMT; letters sent via email (bradstandefer@comcast.net).

Caller: Ms. Donya Figueroa (RN) - from ""the site"" Address: 1400 North Highway 441, Suite 552 Lady Lake, FL 32159 Phone: 352-753-9777 Caller clarified that the patient never receieved any Opdivo. She said that they had received Opdivo (via compassionate use program) to administer to the patient, but he passed away in the meantime. She thinks it was due to brain mets. Thanked caller for clarifying. Informed her that no safety report would be filed since the patient did not receive any of our medication before his passing. Caller went on to ask how she should go about returning the unused Opdivo they received via compassionate use. Placed her a on hold to research further. Since Patient Assistance transferred her to me, they likely wouldn't be the correct group to handle the request. Accordingly to the Opdivo-AVL-HCP request for EAP_compassionate use_REQUIRES CUSTOMIZATION-Mar15) SRL, it seemed that perhaps BMS Access Support could provide her with further assitance. Called BMS Access Support and spoke with Jessica. Jessica advised that they would typically transfer these types of calls to med info for assistance. Explained that I would just let the caller know I would research further offline and get back to her. Returned to speak with caller, but she had set the phone down.

While working at Sinai Hospital, she received 4-5 training sessions from a BMS Clinical Nurse. They told her that patients should ""absolutely not be receiving Opdivo if they are getting more than 10mg daily prednisone equivalents. When she started at her new infusion clinic (several days ago), she saw a colleague giving a patient Opdivo. She asked her colleague if they had asked the patient whether they were receiving any steroids. The colleague said they didn't know they were supposed to ask. After further discussions, she decided to call us to get supporting documentation to show that it should only be used in patients receiving less than 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. Spoke from the Nivolumab-Use of corticosteroids with nivolumab SRL. Caller went on to state in passing, ""Well, I wish I would have known this because there were 2 patients that I held Opdivo on because they were receiving higher steroid doses."" Informed caller that I would be filing a safety report to capture these ""held doses."" She did not have access to any details for the safety report, since she is no longer at the same practice site. Caller then stated that since she has received conflicting information from the BMS Clinical Nurse Trainer and via this SRL, she isn't sure which information to believe. Apologized for the confusion. Explained that I would like to escalate her request to our offline team, so that they clarify and possibly reach out to discuss/clarify with the BMS Clinical Nurse Trainer if necessary. Caller confirmed this would be helpful. She is ok with the 1-2 business day timeframe and would like to be contacted for follow-up via email. Caller had no further questions at this time. Survey not offered due to AE being reported. JJ 31Mar2016 AE needs to be filed in the AM due to EOB time constraints. JJ 31Mar2016 AE filed (188492); emailed Melissa (internal point person) to request approval to escalate. JJ 01Apr2016 Melissa confirmed ok to escalate; case assigned to US-Oncology Queue. JJ 01Apr2016 Information in the corticosteroid treatment letter is accurate. Will send this via email along with a treatment disclaimer. 6Apr2016 CS Drug Information received the following email from the requestor on 08APR2016 and forwarded it to me (since I was the original case owner) on 11APR2016: ""I appreciate the information however, I am still very concerned. The Outpatient Infusion Services at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore received teaching to hold drug. I personally know of 2 patients who had drug held. Please follow up with the reps and clinical educators involved with that area. I recently took a new position at UMBWMC and was told something different spurring my initial inquiry with you.

MH 05MAY2016 Roma stated: ""since hematologic/hematology refers to disorder of the blood/bone marrow and affecting, the production of blood and its components, I think it best to customizes all 3 letters including the following AEs: Thrombocytopenia Leukopenia Lymphopenia Anemia Neutropenia Hgb I would take out management sections since there is no mention of it regarding hematologic AEs and any trials that do not mention hematologic AEs( 057 in NSCLC, 010 in RCC, 037 in melanoma). Do you agree?"" MH10MAY2016 Emailed Roma regarding the following: ""The NSCLC letter is still in the old format, so I?m unable to properly re-order references when taking out information (we do not have Author-It). Would it be possible for you to customize this letter for the response? (2) For the opening summary for the RCC letter, I?m unsure what to leave in/take out. Since I?m customizing with just hematologic abnormalities, it seems strange to keep in some of the wording here. Any guidance you may have would be helpful! (3) For the opening summary for the NSCLC letter, I?m also unsure what to leave in/take out. Most of the info/data in the intro deals with lab values that do not deal with hematologic malignancies. Since I?m customizing with just hematologic abnormalities, it seems strange to keep in some of the wording here. Any guidance you may have would be helpful!"" MH 10MAY2016 Roma stated via email: ""Please assign the case to me. We do not have access to author it either but let me try to customize the NSCLC SRL including the summary section. FOR THE RCC letter under summary, I would take out the last sentence in the first paragraph ?lab abnormalities have also..?, the ?dose modifications? sentence, I would change the 3rd paragraph to ?Further details are provided in the detailed information and the relevant PI.?

Looks like p16 testing was only mandatory in OPC patients (?!!!!) and about 25% patients were overall p16 poitive( are these p16 positive non-oropharyngeal patients, since presumably OPC was excluded) 2) is there another Checkmate that addresses oropharynx cancers specifically? 3) what was the planned duration of Nivo if there were no significant toxicities or progression ( indefinitely or maximum 2 year, etc)? Was re-treatment or treatment beyond progression allowed? 4) How do you interpret HR in PDL1 neg and HPV neg patients since HR ( CI) in both groups crossed 1. The KM curves showed an early overlap, but later separation. Do you have updates on these numbers since AACR? 5) Do you have response analysis based on p16 and / or PDL1 status?
