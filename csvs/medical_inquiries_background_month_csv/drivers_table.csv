AE filed under case # 184924. MH 29MAR2016 4/4/2016 SM Hi, Anila and David, I am writing to request BMS consideration of compassioned use of nivolumab in a patient who was previously treated on CA209-038. This patient is a 78 y/o female with a history of metastatic melanoma in the left inguinal, pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. She was enrolled in Part I of the protocol in 3/2013 when her disease progressed after 4 cycles of ipilimumab. She received nivolumab from 3/2013 to 3/2014 after confirmatory scan x2 showed her disease achieved complete response. Her Follow-up scan #3 was 10/2014 which showed disease in remission. However, the scan in 1/2015 showed mild enlargement of left external iliac lymph nodes with the largest one measured 1.7 x 1.2 cm. The follow-up CT scan in 4/2015 and PET/CT scan in 7/2015 showed the further progression to 2.1 x 1.5 cm with hypermetabolic activity SUV 63. She was started on Keytruda 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in 7/2015. However, follow-up CT scan in 9/2015, PET/CT in 10/2015 and CT in 1/2016 showed interval increase in size of the FDG avid left external iliac adenopathy with the largest lesion measure 28 x 17 cm. Her treatment was changed to nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks on 1/5/2016. After completion of 4 doses of nivolumab, CT scan on 2/29/2016 showed stable disease with the largest lesion measured 2.8 x 1.6 cm. She received the 5th dose of nivolumab on 3/1/2016. However, her insurance, Humana contacted me on 3/11/2016 and told me that further treatment with nivolumab is denied because I could not provide any data to support the use of nivolumab after Keytruda progression. During Peer-to-Peer review, the medical director accused me using my patient as experiment at Humana's expense! I am hoping with your help that BMS will grant compassionate use of nivolumab in this case especially because of her amazing response to nivolumab in 2013 . Thank you very much in advance for your consideration of this special patient. Sincerely, Wen-Jen Sent acknowledgement email and escalating to ACCESS RB 31Mar2016 3/31/16 SM Reached out to BMS Access Support to see if patient has been registered.

I spoke from the Nivolumab-Nivolumab Dako assay SRL and referred her back to the Dako company for more information on this. She also asked how to obtain the test and I spoke from the Opdivo-GEN-PDL1 testing_labs that offer PDL1 test and how PDL1 assays differ-Jul15 SRL. She then indicated that the site coordinator stated that, in order for this patient to be enrolled in this trial, they MUST have a PDL1 test performed on him and that they must have this information within the next 2 days. She is unsure if this needs to be a tissue sample, how they need to obtain the test, if it needs to be taken with the patient to St. Louis (to the site), etc. She said the site coordinator has been unable to provide this information.

He had received chemotherapy (gemcitabine+carboplatin) for a total of 6 cycles since August 2015-January 2016 (his last treatment). The oncologist did not believe that additional session of chemo will benefit him at this stage. The news brought sadness & desperation to the family. I remembered seeing the commercial on Opdivo. After further research, I truly believe that Opdivo may be the best alternative. I contacted my family. My brother-in-law discussed Opdivo with his oncologist. His oncologist agreed to try Opdivo. This gives him hope to live longer. However, the first issue is how to obtain Opdivo since there is no BMS office in Thailand.

Eur J Cancer. 2016 Jun;60:210-25. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2016.02.024. Epub 2016 Apr 13. Abstract BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies represent an effective treatment option for metastatic melanoma and other cancer entities. They act via blockade of the PD-1 receptor, an inhibitor of the T-cell effector mechanisms that limit immune responses against tumours. As reported for ipilimumab, the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These side-effects can involve skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, the endocrine system and other organ systems. Since life-threatening and fatal irAEs have been reported, adequate diagnosis and management are essential. According to the PI, section 6.1, other clinically important adverse reactions in less than 10% of patients treated with Opdivo in Trial 1 were: Cardiac: ventricular arrhythmia Sent email to HCP to possibly narrow the focus of cardiac events. CS 04Aug2016 Per internal team, reaching out to TA's to see if any information to provide. Escalating to US Oncology queue.
